      "description": "How to Convert your Quickbooks Desktop File to Quickbooks Online\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nThis is the new way. This is, we've been doing this for five years, join the cloud revolution. There's no reason to have all your QuickBooks information tied up in a single file when it can just be accessed online. QuickBooks Online is so much easier. So let me just tell you how to do this. I'm recording this video because we still get this request quite a bit when we're talking to new prospects. And so basically what you're going to do is you're going to, you log into QuickBooks Desktop and then make sure your file, like your whole QuickBooks Desktop is all up to date. Save that, save the file. A lot of people sometimes are doing this conversion when they don't actually have a QuickBooks Desktop program. \n\nLike this happens to us quite a bit. Like someone will send us their file. And so for us we have to actually download a trial version of QuickBooks Desktop. So you can just Google QuickBooks Desktop trial version, Intuit has some really good help links on this by the way. Download that trial piece of software, they will actually let you start or convert one account without having to pay for QuickBooks Desktop. So they're very nice about this. They want to incentivize you to get on QuickBooks Online as well. \n\nI think Kruze, on our website, you can click and we have a discount link you can just click through and I forget what the discount is, it's like 30% or something like that. Feel free to do that. And then you are going to, once you have your QuickBooks Online account set up, you are going to go back to QuickBooks Desktop and there is, in the file menu there is an export option you can do. You are going to click that and then it's going to run you through a series of prompts and ask you what the destination is and where in QuickBooks Online you want to convert it. It's all super easy. It's going to be like, it's easier than easy. It shouldn't take you like two minutes to do this, but it's going to be very obvious when you log in to the QuickBooks Online account, what the destination, what it's called. You're going to click \"convert\". You're going to give it, you're basically going to do that and then you're going to give it like 10 minutes. It's going to think, it's going to convert over. You'll get a message that says something like: we'll send you an email when your account has been converted over. \n\nAnd then you are going to go over to QuickBooks Online and refresh or maybe log out and sign in again. And make sure all your data is there. So you're going to want to kind of do a side-by-side comparison to make sure your income statement and your balance sheet, the general ledger, all match what is inside QuickBooks Desktop. I wouldn't recommend like a super thorough craziness, go through every line item. You're going to be able to tell if things are in there by what the balance sheet income statement look like, the general ledger. If everything matches, everything balances, everything's reconciled still, you should be fine. And then you will go over to \"manage my users\" with the, there's a little gear icon in the upper right. \n\nAnd you are going to manage your users and invite your friendly CPA firm, Kruze Consulting, to your accounts. Very, very easy. You do it as an accountant user. This, people don't know this necessarily, but being an account user gives you some superpowers. We can see all of the clients that we work with in one, you know, one giant console, and we can provision permission for each member of our team through that accountant console. So super important to give your accountant access as an accountant, not just as a normal user, because that'll make it kind of difficult for them, especially if you're doing this to get a quote. \n\nLike the context of this for us, a lot of times, if someone has been maybe working with like an old school accountant who only knows desktop, or maybe they have been doing it themselves, and they're looking to professionalize their bookkeeping and taxes. And so this whole kind of jump through these hoops is all to get it into a QuickBooks Online version, where we can easily deliver a quote and tell you what's going on in your book. So I hope this helps, again Intuit does have some really good resources, including some videos on this. So I'm not going to really do like a play by play, insert a play by play video here. But this commentary should be very helpful for you. \n\nBecause there's a couple of places where it gets a little sticky and you know, kind of a hard time knowing where to go. So I hope this helps. If you have any questions, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com. We'll help you out and wish you the best of luck, thanks.",

      "title": "When is the best time to send out a W9 to a vendor to determine if they need a 1099?",
      "description": "When is the best time to send out a W9 to a vendor to determine if they need a 1099?\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today, we're talking about when's the right time to send a W9 to a vendor, so you can figure out if you need to give them a 1099 or not? \n\nSo let's start really slow here. A W9 is a taxpayer information form that's on the IRS website. Technically, you should send this to all of your vendors. But really, you're just worried about the vendors that are independent contractors, sole member LLCs, partnerships, folks like that. You don't have to worry about S corps or C corps. \n\nSo those folks that need a 1099 to basically state what you paid that vendor during the year on a cash basis, so that they can fill out their taxes. The IRS wants them to get a form so they can fill out their taxes. But also, the IRS wants to get that form themselves so they know what that person should be paying in taxes. So there's definitely a giant cross check happening here, where when that contractor fills out their income tax form, the IRS is checking to see what you paid them and what they actually declared. So that's why 1099s are done. \n\nNow 1099s are due every January 31st. And so if you don't do those, it's a really big deal. You'll get fined, I think it's like $1,000 or $2,000 per 1099 not filed. It may even be $10,000. It's a really big number. So you really wanna do this. So when are the best times of the year to send out that W9 so that you can determine whether the vendor gets a 1099 or not? \n\nSo the first one is, I like to send it out right away when you start working with them. Like when you're signing the contract, it's nice to kinda bundle that into the contract, or right before you pay the vendor, especially contractors. Sometimes contractors are disorganized. They're a little harder to reach throughout the year, and so if you can get that information right away, that's always helpful. Store it in a really safe place. \n\nBut sometimes it's kinda like, that's not really a scalable process to stop what you're doing all the time and send the W9. So the other alternative is to do it at the end of the year or right in January, when you're preparing all your 1099s. So and that, the cool thing about that is that allows you to run a giant batch process. And so it's very, very efficient with your time. And also, you've just determined, you've closed your books for the year. So you know exactly what you paid this person on a cash basis. So it makes filling out the 1099, after you get the W9 a lot easier. \n\nSo I would either do it right away, before you actually pay that vendor. Or do it in January, so you can do it in bulk and handle all of your vendors at the same time. The nice thing is using a tool that kinda hides the social security number is actually really important. You do not want a bunch of social security numbers flying back and forth in your email inbox, or in documents in your email inbox. You wanna really minimize that. That's just kind of a threat and it's liability you don't really wanna take. \n\nSo we really like using web tools like Track1099 to handle that stuff because they mask all the social security numbers. So again remember, you need to fill out 1099s every year for all your contractors, partnerships, sole member LLCs that you paid throughout the year. You're gonna do it on a cash basis. \n\nAnd you need to get those filed before January 31st. So it's really important to know the tax status of all those vendors, so that you can send those 1099s out when it's time. Hope that helps, thanks.",

You take care of your compliance. You don't look like a schmuck when the VCs want to give you a term sheet, or the acquirer comes, you know exactly what your tax obligations are. It's something you check off the list early in the year, instead of late in the year. There's a lot of benefits, but the single best benefit is that, if you file your return on time, you actually get to take advantage of what's called the R&D Tax Credit, which is a payroll tax offset. So a lot of times people come to us, they don't care, this is incorrect thinking, by the way, they don't think they need to worry about their taxes, doing them on time, because they lost money and they don't owe any money. \n\nObviously, if you make a profit, you do owe taxes to the IRS, and so you really want to file your taxes on time in that scenario, too. But these are startups that are losing money and then they think, \"Ah, who cares, doesn't matter.\" But what's happening is they're actually losing out on the payroll tax offset from the R&D Tax Credit. Now, if they file their taxes late, they can still get a tax credit, but it's a 20 year carry forward that can only be used against profits. So what's so cool about the payroll tax offset is pretty much everyone who has employees, who's building something, is going to pay payroll taxes. \n\nAnd so the IRS and Treasury allow you to deduct the credit against your payroll taxes. Now, you can only do that if it's filed in a timely manner, to quote the wonderful Internal Revenue Service, the IRS. So, all those startups who are blowing their deadlines, not filing extensions, not caring, are probably costing themselves on, for a seed stage company, it might be $20K. For a Series A company, it's probably 50 to $100K. For Series B companies it can be up to $250K in payroll tax offsets that come from the R&D Tax Credit. \n\nSo this is why I bang on the table and say, \"Please do your taxes on time.\" Also make sure, side note, you're working with someone who actually understands startup taxes. There's so many companies that come to us that have the local bookkeeper or CPA, or they hired someone on Craigslist, or they're working with an online accounting firm that outsources everything to third parties, and doesn't actually do any taxes, even though they advertise they do taxes on their website, which I think that, I don't know if that's actually even kosher or legal, but we see it happen. \n\nAnd these people are groups. They're small time and they don't actually understand tax credits. They don't understand the importance of doing your tax returns on time. They don't understand the importance of actually doing a good, accurate tax return, and having those tax returns match the financials. The first thing that happens when you're going to get acquired, or a VC fund is going to invest in you, is they open your financials. \n\nThey open your tax return. If those do not match, there's a problem, so please do them on time, and do them with someone reputable who actually really knows what they're doing, and look for that CPA designation. That is the industry accreditation. The government regulates CPA firms. They don't regulate people who use third party tax services, or the local Craigslist bookkeeper. \n\nAnd so you can make sure you're getting it done properly if you work with a CPA, kind of like Kruze Consulting.

This is a very common question. \n\nThe answer is you always want to use accrual GAAP-based accounting and you always want to recognize that revenue on a monthly basis as you provide the service over the year. It doesn't matter if you collected the cash up front. If you booked it that way that would be called cash accounting. That's not accrual. That's not the right way to do things for startups. That's not the way that VCs, that's not the way that corporate development offices, they don't view your financials that way. They don't wanna see your financials that way. \n\nThey want to see 'em on an accrual basis every time. And it's better for management and for the investors. Imagine you're sitting in a board meeting and you haven't been booking your reoccurring revenue stream on a monthly basis and your revenue, 'cause it's on cash, is bouncing all around and the board is freaking out because they invested in a SaaS company, thinking this is gonna be a smooth, long build. \n\nAnd you put up a zero this month, right? People are gonna lose their minds. So you're gonna take a lot of grief if your revenue is not booked correctly. And imagine when you go through an M&A, like if the corporate development group or the accounting firm that they hired to do due diligence on you, is looking at this and it's cash accounting, again bouncing all over, not consistent, not SaaS-like, they're gonna be worried that they're working or buying a company that isn't run by a super sophisticated team. They're also gonna be worried that the accounting firm that you're using is not doing their job correctly. \n\nAnd the next natural step is, well, what else is wrong? What else do I not know about? What's lurking beneath the surface here in this M&A deal? And it could literally make the deal fall apart. It could make them give you a haircut. There's a lot of bad things that could happen. So do your revenue recognition correctly, work with a CPA firm that knows what they're doing, that will be there for you during diligence, and always book this stuff on a monthly basis as you earn the revenue as you deliver the service. It doesn't matter if you collect the cash up front, although that's really good for mitigating your burn. \n\nSo definitely try to collect upfront if possible. Hope that helps.

      "description": "How should you present your startup's financial results to the board?\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts\n\nThe first one is like cash versus accrual accounting. The second one is like any kind of vanity metrics or metrics that make you look good. And then the third one is kind of the order and the presentation. So first we're going to go cash and accrual. So this is a very common question from our startup founders and really everything should basically be on accrual except you do want to include the pure cash burn number. So your revenue, your costs, your costs of goods sold, all that stuff and your net income, all that should be on accrual basis. But I like to show the board the actual cash burn. So I'll give them what we call like accrual burn which is usually taken from like your operating income line or your net income line. But that's an accounting burn rate. And then I also like to show them a cash burn which is like purely the amount of cash you had in the bank account last month, the amount of cash you have right now and the difference. And that is your true cash burn. \n\nSo, I like to show, you know, again, accrual for everything and then show an additional cash burn, that's the pure cash burn. And then for vanity metrics, I like to do things like especially if you're a SaaS company, things like bookings. So that's usually like the total contract value of deals that you've recognized or signed in a given month. And the reason why that's important is bookings tend to be a forward indicator. And so if you're signing a bunch of contracts that are one-year, two-year, three-year contracts, that means your revenue's going to be really good in the future as you recognize those contracts and deliver the service. \n\nAnd so the board wants to know that. Some of the other, I wouldn't put this in the summary but other vanity metrics can be like LTV of customer or cost of acquisition and things like that. But I'm really talking about kind of your summary page here. And so, but I do think bookings is a really good way of showing the traction that's happening in the business and it's not going to show up in just your pure revenue recognition right away. So those are kind of the two, the first categories we're going to talk about. \n\nAnd the third one is just what does this actually look like? So I love to have a one-page financial summary very early in a board deck. And the reason for that is the board, they don't always know exactly what's going on financially at the company. So sometimes they're a little jittery or they're just a little nervous and they really kind of need some level setting and you want to let them know where you are. \n\nSo I always like to have just a one-page summary. And this is again, there to kind of level set for them. Just get them oriented and give them a framework to think about the company. What milestones it needs to hit and where you are right now. And so that one page should have something like cash, cash burn for like the last month or last three months or last six months, we give our clients all those metrics. And then your total months of runway and then revenue and ideally bookings. \n\nAnd, really those five metrics will give them, venture capitalists talk to startups all day long. They're very good at doing the back of the envelope math on all financials very quickly. But that will just give them a foundation to look at the rest of your presentation and know if your business has plenty of cash and you don't need to worry. Or, \"Hey, we're getting a little bit low on cash. We need to think about fundraising.\" And they'll be doing the metrics calculations in their head and thinking like, \"Can this company raise another round or do we need to pare back? Whatever we need to do.\" That will help your board. \n\nAnd then the final thing just when you're talking about board meetings I like to have a much fuller, like kind of almost like a section of the presentation late in the board deck with your full profit and loss statement or like a summary but all the big line items, a balance sheet and ideally a cashflow statement. I also really like to show budget to actuals whenever possible on those things. And especially if you're a good management team and you're executing, budget to actuals actually build a ton of confidence in your investors. They know that you're managing the company tightly. It's a little bit of a cheat sheet for them because it actually allows them to ask smart questions, too. They'll see things are out of whack if you're under-hiring or over-hiring or just spending money too much, too fast on marketing, things like that.",

      "description": "What is a 409A Valuation, and why do funded startups need one?\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today, I'm answering the question, \"What is a 409A valuation?\" \n\nAnd a 409A valuation is a valuation that allows you to accurately and legally price your employee stock options. Typically, it's common stock. So back in the day when people would be working at a startup, they would get common stock options, and the board used to kinda make up whatever the price per share was. The old joke in the industry is that it would always be a penny a share, no matter how many shares outstanding and what percentage of ownership of the company, always a penny a share. \n\nAnd then about 15 years ago, the IRS got smart, and they said, you know what? We think 409A valuation, or we think stock options are systematically being underpriced. And so they instituted the rules that led to 409A valuations. So basically, that means a third-party valuation provider, who's accredited, needs to actually do a couple different analyses to figure out what the fair market value of the common stock prices, and therefore what the stock option price is gonna be. And there's a couple ways to do that. \n\nThe back solve method is typically the most popular in the startup world, because the valuation provider can work backwards, hence, back solve, against the valuation that was just recently done by an independent venture capitalist who put money into the company. So typically, the back solve method yields a valuation of 25 to 35% of preferred. It can bounce around a little bit, but that's kind of the area. Another method is the cost to recreate. You can just look at that and say hey, we've built all this technology. We've got maybe all this revenue. What would it take to build this from scratch? And you have to do a pretty thorough job of listing everything out, itemizing everything, and your accountant usually gets involved. \n\nBut that's another way to do the valuation. Other ways are free cashflow analysis, or just discounted cashflow analysis, comparable multiples analysis. There's a bunch of different ways, but in the startup world, it's usually back solve or cost to recreate. But because there's all these parameters now, there's companies that do 409A valuations, Kruze, we do those with a partner, tons of them. And they're really cheap. The pricing has really come down. I think it starts at $2,000 for us. And because a lot of technology and a lot of systems have been put in place to make these scalable, and be able to a lot of 409As, the price has come down. \n\nSo it's a great time if you're needing 409A valuations, 'cause they are affordable, easy to get. It takes usually about two weeks, two business weeks, to get a 409A, but if your startup is gonna issue stock options to your employees, you're gonna need a 409A, because you don't wanna cross the IRS. And some people think oh, the IRS isn't gonna audit me, or something like that. Well, you have audit risk with the IRS, but you also have audit risk with a late-stage audit partner. \n\nSo typically, when companies hit series C or series D, they're gonna start getting audits every month, every year, excuse me, because the late-stage venture capitalists are putting a lot of money in these companies. They wanna make sure everything's audited, and really getting ready for an IPO, something like that. And if that late-stage audit firm, like a Deloitte, KPMG, E and Y, see that you didn't do 409As, or the 409As are, for whatever reason, not done properly or underpriced, they will actually throw a wrench in your audit and make you do a repricing of those options and take basically charges against your financials. \n\nAnd they're doing you a favor, 'cause they're keeping you in compliance, they're keeping you clean. The last thing you wanna do is get to the doorstep of an IPO and have a lot of stock option compensation problems. So really, it's kinda like a lot of things in accounting and tax, these rules are set up to kinda protect you, in a way. But it's just best practice. Get a 409A valuation. They're good for a year, or until you have a material change in your valuation. And if you need help, just hit us up at Kruze. Hope that helps, thanks!",

      "description": "How can you tell if your Accountant is doing Cash Accounting vs. Accrual Accounting?\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nYou want to be on accrual accounting. I'm kind of chuckling here, but you really do. That's what you and your investors are gonna need to know how you're spending money. Because accrual accounting basically puts the expenses and revenue in the periods that they were earned or incurred. Cash accounting is just like, it's like the Wild West. It's like whenever the money came into the bank account or left the bank account. And so it's really hard to predictably run your business on a cash accounting basis because you have these like giant bulk payments to suppliers or contractors, or maybe you get a big prepayment in from a customer and so you have like this one lump sum, either a revenue or expense, and you don't actually know when it was earned. You don't have the predictability of knowing what's actually gonna happen in the future. So accrual accounting is super duper important, you definitely wanna be on it. \n\nNow, I hate to say this, but like kind of the Craigslist special bookkeeper who you found on Craigslist, those are the kind of people who wanna do stuff on a cash accounting basis, or a lot of the, \"automated firms\" that usually aren't really that automated, they're the ones who wanna do cash accounting because it's so much easier for them. All they do is take, again, those cash entries from your bank account and slam them into QuickBooks and call it a day. It is so much easier than actually accruing things over the correct time periods. But again, to have the visibility, you need that stuff accrued over the right time period. So let me give you a couple examples. One example is revenue. So say you are a SaaS based company and you sell a 12 month deal to a client, and they're gonna pay $120,000 for the year. You want to accrue that revenue and spread it out over each month. You wanna do revenue recognition, which is the foundation of accrual accounting. So each month out of 12, you're gonna give yourself $10,000 of revenue. \n\nAnd for the revenue that is not earned yet because you haven't gotten to those time periods where you're actually serving the customer, that's gonna sit on your balance sheet as deferred revenue. Now, a lot of investors look at deferred revenue and they know that's predictable revenue the company is gonna be able to count in the future. So that's a really good way of doing it. Now, if you're doing cash accounting, you would just take that $120,000 deposit. Boom, put it in one month, and then you got zeros the rest of the time. That's gonna look really bumpy and weird, and it's definitely gonna come up at your board meeting. So do it the accrual accounting way. Another example on the expense side is say you have just an amazing graphic designer and they re-did your entire website. \n\nAnd you know, you asked them to do that work and they did it in February, of a given month And they got it all done in February, but they invoiced you in March, and then you actually got around to paying them in April. So on a cash accounting basis, that's just gonna look like a really big expense in April, but actually you should be accruing that expense for the time period it was delivered or the service was delivered, which is February. So that's gonna be way more accurate on your financials. You might get to your board meeting in May and someone's like, hey, what's this giant April expense? And you're gonna be looking at it. You're not actually gonna really remember because that graphic designer did the work for you in February. Or heaven forbid, that graphic designer did their work in February and March, two months and you finally paid them in April. \n\nAgain, you're gonna have that big bulk payment in April, but actually that expense should have been spread out over February and March. So you really wanna do things on accrual basis. Again, it just gives you more visibility into your business. It also makes your tax returns more accurate. You really wanna have your tax returns filed on an accrual basis. If there's some, maybe not so great tax accountants and bookkeepers who outsource to those tax accountants, who will always file you on a cash basis because it's easier for them, but then you have to switch over and actually notify the IRS that you're switching to accrual basis eventually. \n\nAnd so that's expensive, it takes time, you have to fill out some forms, And the IRS is always inundated with stuff. So sometimes they could actually unintentionally lose something, and you might have to sit there and wait for your tax return to be filed, which could cost you money on your R&D Tax Credit rebate. So there's just a lot of reasons to be on accrual accounting, not just for your financials, but on your tax return.",

      "description": "How should Startups distribute cash to existing shareholders right before an acquisition?\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question, how should startups distribute cash to existing investors right before an acquisition? \n\nSo this is a happy scenario here. This is a company, your company is getting bought and odds are, if you're a venture-backed startup you've probably raised a bunch of cash. And so sometimes companies get bought right after they raised a bunch of VC cash or somewhere in the middle and they haven't really run that cash down. And so, right before they get bought, as part of the acquisition or the merger, the seller, the company that's getting bought will negotiate with the acquirer and say like, \"Look, we've got 5 or 10 or $20 million of cash on our balance sheet that our investors put into this company. And you know what? We don't wanna just sell a company, give you that money. We want that money back. That's part of the acquisition price in our head.\" And if you negotiate this with the buyer, they'll understand that. \n\nSometimes the buyers do wanna kind of roll that into the acquisition price. If they're paying $100 million and you've got $20 million of cash on your balance sheet. They're really thinking we're buying you for $80 million. That's why it's important to really negotiate this and make sure it's clear to everyone. So you don't have any surprises right before close. But, most acquirers that we deal with are pretty savvy, fortune 500 companies, and so they get this. So, say you've got that extra $20 million on your balance sheet and you're getting bought in a week. Well, the investors want that money back and they should get that money back. \n\nAnd so the way you do it is you issue a 1099-DIV. This is a tax form and you will put the dividend amount in box three. If you do a little Googling, you'll see box three is basically a non-dividend distribution. Meaning, like there weren't profits, the company... And again, I should clarify that, this is for startups that weren't generating a profit. Profit would be a different, if you're distributing profits that'd be a different scenario. But, this is for companies that have raised a bunch of money who are burning a bunch of money but have built something of value and so they're getting acquired for their market position, their intellectual property, how awesome the business looks going forward. But they never generated profit. And so therefore, you do put the amount for distributed into box three because that is a non-dividend distribution. \n\nNow, with the 1099-DIV, you do need to report out to the folks that you actually made this distribution to. Send them the 1099 before January 31st of the following tax year. So say, I'm recording this in early 2021. Say you make this distribution now. In January of 2022, that's when you're gonna send out the 1099-DIV. So it's really important that you actually give your investors, the people you're distributing this capital to their 1099-DIV, because they need that to report on their own taxes. If they don't get that, they may miss it. The IRS will flag it, see it and it could create some tax problems. So be organized, make sure your tax firm like Kruze, who's taking you through this acquisition is actually there for, ready to do this and knows they need to do this. \n\nBut, this is a good thing. I mean, we do see this quite a bit where companies, especially now the market's hot, companies are able to raise quite a bit of capital, but guess what? Acquirers, this is probably the reason the market's hot, acquirers are buying a lot of startups right now. And the acquirers who are savvy kind of understand that this is an incremental amount of money in addition to the purchase price. And so definitely negotiate this, totally normal to do. Don't hesitate and if the person who's buying it, buying you is saying, this is not marker or this is not what happens. They're wrong because this does happen quite a bit. \n\nSo, I hope that helps. 1099-DIV non-dividend distribution, that is the way you do this. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "How can an angel investor sell their shares?\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nBut the idea is you're basically getting a better currency than the private shares you own in the startup and ideally cash is the best currency to get. One little thing, if you do get equity and it's like all equity or there's certain thresholds, I think it's 75% of the considerations in equity, then it's actually a tax deferred sale and you don't have to pay taxes on it immediately. Only the part that you actually get in cash, I believe, you pay taxes on. And so the equity you can just roll that over, you don't have to sell. Say, Microsoft buys one of your angel investment companies, oh, you can just own Microsoft stock for as long as you want and you don't have to pay taxes on it until you sell that Microsoft stock. So very, very nice. \n\nThe second situation where you're selling your shares is in an IPO. And the company has done so well that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, whoever is taking this company public, initial public offering. Now typically in the IPO the company sells kind of 10 to 20% of its total shares outstanding. Typically it creates actually new shares to sell that way. Sometimes there is like a secondary component where the demand for the stock is so strong on Wall Street that some of the insiders will actually be allowed to sell in the IPO. Fairly rare, but that does happen sometimes. So you could sell a little bit in the IPO, like the actual transaction, but just know pretty much any time one of your companies does an IPO, you will be restricted from anywhere, usually it's six months restricted from trading or selling any of your shares. \n\nAnd the way the mechanics on this work is typically like a venture capital fund, they want to come in and put a bunch of money in the company, but maybe they can only get 10% ownership or 15% ownership but their targeted ownership level is 20% ownership. If you think about it from the VC's perspective, they're making a bet on this company, they have conviction. They're professional money managers, if they have conviction they want to own as much as possible. And so most VC firms target 20%. And so, a way for them to get up to 20% if there's not enough preferred shares to buy is to buy common shares from the management team and from the angel investors, angels usually own common. \n\nPlease let me know how much you would want to share. The target price is X dollars per share. And so everyone on that email list can basically do the math themselves. Sometimes angels want to get their cost basis back. Maybe they've made 20X on the investment and they feel like it's good for them to just get their money back at least and then let the rest ride. Other times if it's an angel fund or a pre-seed fund, this investment may be big enough to return the whole fund or maybe if they even sell 10 or 20% of that investment, they can return their whole fund. \n\nAnd so that's a really big moment for a venture capital fund, early stage venture capital fund or angel fund to return everything. And so they'll sell whatever it takes to get to that threshold and then let the rest ride. But it's really their kind of decision. I remember when I was talking to Jason Calcanis on his podcast, he was talking about how Uber, when SoftBank came into Uber, Uber came in and approached a bunch of the angel investors and said like, \"Hey SoftBank's not getting the ownership position they want. Is there anything you can do to let some of your shares go, sell them to SoftBank? We really want SoftBank to be on our side, Uber side, invested in Uber instead of maybe looking around and investing in Lyft or something like that.\" \n\nAnd so Calcanis, it wasn't just he was taking money off the table but strategically it was important to make sure this investor had enough ownership in the company because they were a big dog, they had a lot of money and so they wanted him on Uber's side. And so that was part of the reason why he decided to sell some of his shares of Uber to SoftBank in a secondary. Now there's another kind of way to get liquidity in a secondary, which is through a marketplace. There's a lot of marketplaces that popped up. And what they're doing is kind of matching private buyers. Maybe they don't have an ownership position in the company yet, but they've heard good things about it or their friend's an investor or whatever it is.",

      "title": "Does an angel Investor pay capital gains taxes on an investment in their IRA?",
      "description": "Does an angel Investor pay capital gains taxes on an investment in their IRA?\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering a question, does an angel investor pay capital gains taxes on a startup investment made through their IRA? And for those who don't know, IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account. \n\nIt's, basically, like the tax deferred or pre-tax contributions, that you make into a retirement account. And the world's gotten pretty cool, it's gotten very open. You can actually use your IRA to make angel investments now, whether you're working through Carta or AngelList, or there's a bunch of ways to do it, Alto. Lot of different platforms that allow you to tap into that 401(k), or excuse me, your IRA, and make the angel investment. 401(k)'s a little different, but if you roll that 401(k) over into an IRA, you can do it. \n\nSo, basically, the answer is no, you will not pay capital gains taxes immediately, right at the second when you sell those shares. So when you use a traditional IRA or 401(k), and you've made those angel investments through there, well guess what, you don't pay taxes until you draw the money out. Typically, people wait as long as possible to draw the money out, because again, it's tax deferred. And the power of this is you can make multiple, you can make many investments on the same dollars over time if you keep it in an IRA for 20 or 30, 40 years, right? There's a famous example of Peter Thiel who invested in PayPal via his IRA, and then took that money, which he made a lot on, and invested in Facebook, which he made even more on, right? \n\nSo his IRA is completely tax-deferred on pretty big numbers. He was able to compound that over multiple angel investments. Now, there is some pending, or talk of legislation, of limiting the tax benefit on IRAs depending on how big. The numbers I saw were anything over 5 or $10 million in your IRA, you're gonna end up paying additional taxes on, or not get the tax deferred nature. That's something for the politicians to work out. \n\nAlso, for most people watching this, you're going to need a couple of humongous wins on those IRA investments, to even have to worry about that. Albeit, Peter Thiel investing in PayPal and Facebook, but for all of us, most of us, that would be a great problem to have. So for most of us, just know if you put it in like a traditional IRA or 401(k), when you take the money out, is when you start paying taxes, not when you've, actually, when you, actually, sell the shares, right, if they're sitting in a traditional IRA. \n\nSo, hope that helps. If you have any questions on this, give us a call or give us a shout at kruzeconsulting.com, thanks.",

      "title": "How to read a Balance Sheet?",
      "description": "How to read a Balance Sheet?\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nA balance sheet is really kind of a snapshot of where you are right in that moment of time. So we'll start with the assets. The three kind of sections on a balance sheet are assets, liabilities, and equities. And we'll start with the assets side. Oftentimes I kind of visualize a balance sheet as like assets on the left and the liabilities and the equity on the right. And they have to balance each other out. So that's always really helpful to know. I don't wanna be cheesy but that's kind of why they call it a balance sheet. \n\nSo let's go assets. So the most important asset in any business is cash. You have to do know what's in the bank account. And oftentimes people have maybe a couple of entries on their balance sheet. They have a checking account and a savings account. Oftentimes they also have like money market accounts where the big chunk of cash is sitting, that they don't need in operating on a daily basis, but they want to get a little higher interest rate. So cash, just always know that number. A little pro tip here, when you go into a board meeting that morning always pull up your bank account online and check and see your exact number of cash. Your exact amount of cash in the bank. Board members love that. They love to just be able to say, how much cash we have, and it's so empowering to say, \"Well as of today, \"right this moment we have X, Y, and Z amount of cash.\" So that's the cash side. You're also gonna have accounts receivable. This is money that is owed to you from your customers. \n\nNow, the other types of short-term assets might be, you might have like other assets like weird deposits or things like that. Or maybe prepays, like you might've prepaid a vendor to get a better deal. That's another asset account. And then as you move down you'll have things like rental security deposits. You know, if you're in a WeWork you're gonna end up paying, one or two, two and a half times your rent in a deposit. Same thing with like a normal landlord. You also are going to typically buy equipment. Now the IRS has a capitalization limit of $2,500. So if you buy something over $2,500 you're gonna capitalize it, which means putting it on your balance sheet and putting it into the equipment or asset section of your balance sheet.  \n\nAnother one to think about is credit cards. People don't always think of credit cards, but that is essentially a line of credit or debt and credit cards typically need to be paid back within a 30 day period. So those go in the short-term liability section. And credit cards can get pretty big. Like a lot of startups, I don't really recommend this, but sometimes they have some pretty big charges on their credit card. I always recommend startups. They typically have some cash because they've raised angel or VC money to always pay their credit cards. There's no reason to be paying interest every month. Just pay your credit cards off every month. It's good discipline. \n\nAnd now we start sliding down. There's other things like accrued expenses, other types of liabilities that you have to think about. And then you also have to think about short-term and long-term debt. Sometimes startups or small businesses they take loans, like letters of credit or they take venture debt in the case of startups. And part of that debt needs to be paid back in the next 12 months. So that should be accrued on the short-term debt side of the equation. \n\nAnd then anything after that's due after 12 months will be long-term debt. Those are the big ones there. You'll see, typically see a much larger balance on long-term debt if you've taken a big venture debt deal. Those are the basics of the liability side of the equation. There's other little things that can pop up. And we actually, sometimes it's a lot easier to track, like if there's a weird liability you might have, instead of just lumping it into other liabilities or something like that, that's kind of generic, we like to create its own liability account so it's very clear. And so when you look at your balance sheet, the balance sheet is all about knowing how much cash and resources you have in the bank and then what you owe people. \n\nNow, one thing I forgot to cover in the liability section is convertible debt. It's like SAFE notes and convertible debt are basically the same thing, but convertible debt does have a small coupon and typically does need to be paid back if it doesn't convert to equity. So that would be in the liability section.",

So, we always start with the two fundamentals, which are transaction volume and dollar amount spent. So, transaction volume is just simply like how many transactions do you have? And at this point in the analysis we're not really worrying about whether they're like easy stuff like Uber, or more complex stuff like international wires, or international payments, or contractor payments that span many months or things like that, right. \n\nWe're just kind of ballparking the transaction volume. Because every, you know, every, an accountant has to get all those transactions into QuickBooks, right, so there's a certain amount of time for each transaction. The second bucket is dollars spent. This is a quick kind of shortcut to see like how much is the company actually spending every month? And it correlates very nicely with transaction volume. And also gives you, shows you like when you combine those two you might have some outliers in transaction volume that get picked up or are easy to understand with dollar amounts. So, for example, maybe you've got just an extreme amount of transactions, but they're all like $5 Uber rides, right? Well, actually that's pretty easy. \n\nAnd I'll get to the reason why that's easier later, for Kruze. But that's much, much simpler than a bunch of more complex, bigger dollar amount transactions. So, we're looking at both those. And then we start thinking about complexity, which I've touched on a little bit here, but like whenever you're paying a bunch of contractors or vendors with multi-month stuff, well when you're doing GAAP accounting like Kruze, which is what startups should do, that's what VCs want, you have to spread or allocate those transactions over the time service is provided and do it on an accrual method. And, so, that's just a very simple example of complexity. \n\nOther versions of complexity can be, you know, it's prepays or revenue that's collected in advance, so you have deferred revenue and recognized revenue. You have to split that out. You might have some complexity around fixed asset schedules, or, is this, should this be booked as a fixed asset or not? What does GAAP say? So, there's a bunch of kind of judgment calls and things like that that accountants have to make, generally speaking. So, that's the third ingredient. Now, this is where it gets kind of fun, because if you're using good systems you can actually save a lot of money. When our startup clients are using great credit card systems like Brex, and Ramp and Airbase, and very good startup banks like SVB, or First Republic, Mercury, Bridge Bank, Comerica, stuff that has premium systems, great payroll, Rippling, Gusto, Justworks, TriNet, it actually can help automate some of those transactions for us. \n\nKruze has his own system too. And, so, if you're using kind of a more old school credit card firm, or old school bank, or things like that, our system actually learns from the text in the bank feed that comes in and can automatically categorize a lot of that stuff. And, so, that's a little bit of our secret sauce. It's a very minimal part of our secret sauce, frankly, because it's all about the accountant's judgment, accountant's training, and frankly, communication with the client. But that helps quite a bit. \n\nSo, doing that monthly call, making sure they're keeping up with all the questions we're asking them, and that we're answering their questions, very, very powerful. Really helps everyone, and helps Kruze deliver a better service to the client. So, you're going to include a higher price in the bookkeeping package if you are actually doing those monthly calls, which again, we really prefer and believe in. The next one is tax compliance. Are you going to include tax compliance in the monthly bookkeeping package? Now, at Kruze, we have an in-house tax team. We don't outsource at all.",

Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\n#californiabusinessconnect #californiabusiness #kruzeconsulting\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more accounting, HR, and finance tips for your startup.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/KruzeConsulting\n\nMORE FROM KRUZE CONSULTING:\nWebsite ► https://kruzeconsulting.com/\nYouTube ► https://www.youtube.com/c/KruzeConsul...\nFacebook ► https://www.facebook.com/KruzeConsulting\nTwitter ►https://twitter.com/KruzeConsulting\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today, we're talking about a really new exciting development from the State of California. \n\nThey are coming out with California Business Connect, a revamped, revitalized, awesome online system for filing incorporation documents, tax payments, tons of stuff, everything you basically need to do, they are virtualizing a lot of stuff that you have to do kind of by hand still or at the State of California or things like that. So it's really exciting because it's been a tough couple years for everyone, from the IRS down to all the state tax agencies, to your friendly accountants, your friendly CPA firms, like Kruze, because COVID really threw a lot of wrenches in everything. And with all the PPP Programs and Employee Retention Tax Credits and all the other stimulus programs, all the state agencies have been really, and IRS, have been really underwater, through no fault of their own, it's just been an incredible amount of work. \n\nAnd so, it's really exciting to see, despite that, some cool innovation coming out of the State of California, and it's going to make everyone's life a lot easier. Now, the cut over date is March 29th, 2022. And leading up to that date, there's going to be some of the like online filings or online access stuff that exists right now are not going to be accessible, just know that, don't plan on doing anything super important that week because it could be offline or momentarily offline. But the new system will launch on March 29th, it's been tested a lot, it's been vetted. So at Kruze, we're really excited about this. \n\nNow you might say like, \"What are some of the things that I'll be able to do on this website?\" So one of the big things is you're going to get online access to the Secretary of State business records, and you'll be able to file stuff online 24/7, right? Like, the website's not going to go down, you're not going to be relying on going actually to like a physical location and filing stuff, which seems like kind of table stakes, but it's actually really important. And a lot of times you have to get like good standing or things like that, or get something fixed when a registration that's gone stale or old, there actually is a lot of physical process and high fees that you have to pay to like a servicer or someone like that right now. \n\nSo this is going to be really nice, being able to do everything online will be fantastic. Save people a lot of money and a lot of time. Now, another thing you're going to be able to do is there's like tons of forms for, we're talking LLCs, S-Corps, C-Corporations, but the new California Business Connect site is going to allow you to access over 70 electronic forms and submit them, submitting is the big part. It's easy to put a PDF online, but being able to submit it electronically is going to be a really, really big deal. You're also going to be able to do image searches on corporations and be able to see like certain documentation, actually be able to look at it on the website, not request a copy to be mailed to you later. That's another big kind of workflow improvement time saver for folks like us, like CPA firms. \n\nSome of the other like cool things is just being able to do like business name searches in a much easier way. And one of the other cool things they're going to be able to do is multifactor authentication through like Okta, basically being able to sign in through different ways and verify that you are actually the person signing in and not a robot or a hacker somewhere down the road. So I'm super excited about this, kudos to the State of California for actually being innovative in this very tough time. You know, lot of the startups out there watching this video may not realize how much back and forth there is between the accounting firm and the State of California, or how much time we spend on hold, or how many times the poor agents we're talking to can't find a document that we send in, or are overwhelmed themselves because of the call volume.",

      "description": "Why do General Partner Venture Capitalists contribute cash to the funds they manage?\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $6 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today, I'm answering the question, why do general partner venture capitalists contribute cash to the funds they manage? It's a great question. \n\nGeneral partners are like kind of the, they're the people in front. They're the people doing the deals at the VC funds. They're signing the checks, all that kind of stuff. They're the people you read about in the news. They're the people wooing entrepreneurs taking them to coffee, giving them a term sheet. That is the GP role. And the LP role, limited partner, are the money people. Those are institutions like endowments, foundations, pension funds, high net worth individuals. Those are the people who invest in the venture capital funds and give that capital to the general partners or GPs and so circling back to the question, well the reason why GPs invest cash in their own funds are, there's two reasons. \n\nThe first one is that limited partners like it. I mean, if you're putting some extra money into a vehicle for it to be invested, you definitely want the general partner to have some skin in the game, right? You want them thinking about their money when they're spending your money. So, oftentimes, limited partners will require like one to two percent, sometimes more, of a fund be actually cash contributed by the general partners and the goal here is to align incentives and make sure the GPs don't do any crazy deals they wouldn't do with their own money, right? Like, again, everyone wants alignment. Now, if you're someone who hasn't had a ton of success in the venture capital industry, those capital calls are actually pretty painful because you really don't have any money and so oftentimes banks will actually do capital call loans. SVB does this. First Republic does this where they actually will finance some of the capital calls for you to make this a little bit less painful on a cash basis for the GPs, but you're still in alignment because those are recourse loans like you can't just get out of that loan if the venture fund doesn't do well. So number one by far is just LPs want alignment with the GPs. That's number one. \n\nNumber two, if you're running a fund and you're good at it, well wouldn't you want more money in that fund? Venture capitalists are very good at what they do for the most part and it's a very high return potential vehicle industry and so you see a lot of VCs actually putting more than the minimum into their fund and there was actually something that happened pretty recently, which I thought was cool where Homebrew, one of the dominant seed stage funds, actually decided they were just going to start investing their own money. That's it, they weren't even going to invest any other LP capital. They're just investing their own money. \n\nObviously, they've done pretty well over the years and are pretty wealthy to be able to do that, but they don't have investors to answer to. It's, you know, limited partners are really the boss of the GP partners in a way, not always. I mean, the power dynamics can be very different like the top tier Sand Hill funds or best New York funds, you know, the LPs feel lucky to be able to invest in those funds, but if you're an up-and-comer or you're a good fund, but not like the number one or number two fund in the industry, you have to listen to what the LPs ask of you and say to you and so Homebrew basically just decided they're just going to invest their own money, which kudos to them. But you do see a lot of GPs putting more than the minimum in just because they know this is a high return vehicle. \n\nI mean, if you could invest in Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz you probably would, too, right? They have a really good track record. So that answers the question, hopefully. One other little fun thing is you see this every kind of down cycle. Venture capitalists also like to invest in each other's funds. So oftentimes like the GP of one fund will be an LP in five or 10 other funds. So hope that helps. That's why GPs invest cash in their own funds to make the LPs happy and create alignment and to, hopefully, take advantage of their awesome performance and make a lot of money for themselves. \n\nHope that helps.

      "description": "What Recent Increase in Inflation Mean for Cash Management Programs\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nInflation is becoming something that people are talking about. It's very understandable. I mean, we're not out of COVID yet, but we've, I'm recording this towards the end of 2021 and the government has pumped a lot of stimulus money into the economy, the last year and a half. I mean, that's part of what kept as many people employed as, as were. I mean, there was a lot of job losses, but broadly speaking, a lot of people were able to maintain their jobs and sustain their standard of living. \n\nAnd so, that stimulus money, ultimately starts creating inflation. The other thing that's happened is like the economies of the world are improving. And so, things were like a standstill in mid 2020, and now there's a lot more commerce. People are buying stuff, people are traveling, like stuff's happening. And so it's kind of natural from that stop to triggering and getting the economy to run at 100% again, that there's going to be inflation. Like people need timber, they need oil, they need energy. All these things are happening and people want it now because they want to get going. And so that's creating inflationary pressure. Now we'll have to see if this is going to last or not. It all depends on who you talk to. \n\nAnd no one really knows. Personally, I think it'll be a little more temporary, maybe than most people. But there is inflation creeping in the economy. And if you're a startup sitting on a good amount of cash, you're asking yourself like, \"Well, what can I do?\" or \"How should I change my cash management policy?\" And frankly, I don't think you should do very much to change your cash management policy, because if you were doing things, best practices before. \n\nSo if you had an investment policy, written document that your board had approved and that you were investing in a mix of either like a money market fund with your bank or doing something where you're kind of doing bond ladders, where you're buying corporate and US treasury bonds out until 12 months out kind of thing, and kind of staggering them. If you're doing all those things, you're actually not going to want to do a whole lot because you're doing it the right way and you're safe. \n\nAnd if you watch any of the other videos on cash management and startup, safety is actually the number one thing. But ideally you wouldn't be losing some of your cash balance kind of implicitly to inflation. And so you can look to some of those, changing the mix a little bit to corporate bonds. You might be, all in treasuries or all in CDs or things like that at your bank. And maybe mix in some of those like, Google/Starbucks/Microsoft bonds that still are not going to pay very much interest, but will pay you a little bit more than what your bank's paying you on the balance sheet. The other thing that could start happening, if inflation continues, is that the bond market is going to adjust. And what that means is, the bond market is smart. \n\nThey know that if there's inflation happening, they're going to want to get a higher return, a higher interest on the money that the bond markets effectively lend to all the companies or countries across the world. And so interest rates start to go up and the price of bonds goes down. That's kind of how that inverse relationship works. And so the bonds that you are holding, the bonds that you buy in the future as interest rates start to go up, will actually give you a higher return. It's interesting because the bonds you hold right that minute, if interest rates start going up, are actually worth less. So you'll probably just hold them and run them off. That's kind of the concept of a bond ladder. You just have bonds maturing every month for a year. \n\nBut the future bonds you buy are going to have a higher interest rate if this continues and that will help cushion and reduce the impact of inflation. You can see it's a giant cycle, it's a self-fulfilling cycle. The more people talk about inflation, the more people start to see it. The more the bond market gets nervous, the more interest rates start to go up, the price of bonds goes down and it becomes a cycle. I mean, that's how we got into like the hyperinflation of the early 1980s. That and energy prices were a major problem. So it's something to keep an eye on.",

      "description": "Do you know that you can get Outsourced CFO Services for your business?\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nAs the company gets bigger, it's time to bring in a startup CFO or interim CFO or outsourced CFO services. There's all kinds of different terms that people use to talk about these. And really the job description is, or functions they provide is, you know, firstly, it usually starts with like financial modeling, and budget to actuals. And financial modeling is really you know, a three-year plan at least, looking forward to see where the company's going revenue-wise, where it's going expense-wise how much capital the company is going to need to raise. And are their growth rates sufficient for further VC funding? You know, what milestones do we need to hit before we can raise VC funding? All these things are really important to include in a financial model. I recommend every startup have a financial model. \n\nAt Kruze we believe this so strong, we actually have like a free financial model on our website. It's pretty slimmed down, because the companies that tend to use it tend to be smaller ones, because they don't need something super customized. But it's there if you need it. There's a bunch of financial models on Google. This thing called Google, just search that. But financial models is the first thing. And then the next thing is budget to actuals. This is... I love budget to actuals. Because you get to overlay all the hard work you're doing on the accounting, and put that into the financial model and see where you're spending too much money, where you're underinvesting. Are you tracking above your revenue targets? Are you below? Is something going wrong? It's like your early warning detection system. \n\nAnd so doing budget to actuals every month, can be very powerful. It also inspires a lot of confidence in your board. If you can tell them where you are budget to actual wise, because they'll typically approve the financial model, in every January or December for the following year. And so having budget actual visibility, is very, very effective. The other thing a outsourced CFO can do, is really do a lot of your board prep, like the presentation prep, certainly the financial prep that goes into the board meeting. They should be taking care of. And you know, board meetings they sneak up on you. They come every six weeks, every two months. \n\nAnd it's a lot of work for the executive team at a startup. And so having someone that you can trust to assemble all the financial data, we do this for a lot of our clients, like our controllers do this. But as the companies get bigger, it becomes a lot more. And so having an outsourced CFO, can be really, really helpful there. The other thing that an outsourced CFO can do, is track other important metrics. Like your customer acquisition costs, and LTV like lifetime value of a customer, or some of the other like Ops stuff, like spend in certain categories, especially like IT/software infrastructure spend, things like that. Those expenses sneak up on people. And sometimes like the CTO is not talking to the CEO, and it helps to have a little bit of intermediary there, to just justify some of that spend. So that's important. Another thing is just managing the controller and accounting team. So, you know, for a lot of companies, Kruze works with obviously we're the controller and staff accounting team. \n\nAnd so sometimes for us, it's nice to have someone who really knows our language, and who's diligent and is very incentivized to actually answer all of our questions. That's kind of, one of our biggest issues is just getting our questions answered. And so having that interface with a CFO, who can talk to the founder when appropriate, but really probably most of the time not bother the founder, or the executive team with our questions is really, really valuable for us. And then there are obvious things, that a CFO should do also are help drive the fundraising process. Like when you go on to fundraising, it's very very helpful, to have the CFO on your side. Sit in the presentations, update presentations follow up on all the diligence. Again, Kruze does that as well, but if you're raising a big amount of money that can be helpful. \n\nAnd then also doing things like venture debt, after you've completed an equity fundraising, can be very helpful because it can extend your runway. And the lenders are looking for a lot of the same stuff, but some different stuff. And so getting them all the diligence materials helps a lot. And then finally when you get into an M&A situation, and there's huge dollars around, it does help to have a CFO. M&A events are always chaotic. They're also very emotional.",

      "description": "Is it common to see a convertible note convert a portion into Common Stock and Preferred Equity?\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts\n\nHey, Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question is it common to see a convertible note or SAFE note converted into partially common stock and partially preferred equity? \n\nAnd the answer is yes, this does happen quite a bit, especially at the seed stage level. And I have some examples here. We have some very simple math. I hope you can follow it. If not, just shoot us an email and we'll explain it. But basically, say a seed stage company takes a million dollar investment from the seed stage investor and they're doing it in a SAFE note or convertible debt. Eventually, those two instruments are gonna convert to preferred equity when a bigger round is actually funded. But for right now, the cap or the effective valuation in the convertible note or SAFE note is $5 million. Effectively, the investor's getting 20% of the company. \n\nNow, along comes the series A firm that says we love this company, there's been a lot of growth and they're gonna lead a  $5 million series A preferred round at a $20 million pre. So $20 million pre, plus five million investment equals a $25 million post-money valuation. And so the seed stage investor and the entrepreneur, but the seed stage investor in our case is really excited. They basically own 20% of a company that's now valued at $25 million. So effectively, they have $5 million worth of value in this company. Now, here's where we start getting into our question. If that initial $1 million was converted all into preferred, the investor would have $5 million of preferred but they only put in $1 million. And so their liquidation preference, basically, the investors get their money back before anyone else. The liquidation preference would be $5 million. \n\nThat's effectively a 5X liquidation preference over what they put in. And this isn't really fair to anyone. The series A preferred investors don't like it because they put in five and their liquidation preference is only getting five. The founders don't like it 'cause all of a sudden, there's a bunch more money sitting in front of them before they can participate. So it's really unfair and so some really smart lawyers came up with the solution to solve this. And what they started doing was giving the seed stage investor their million dollar liquidation preference, the 1X, the money they put in and then the rest of the ownership is split up into common equity. Common equity typically does not have a liquidation preference. \n\nAnd so this was a win-win for everybody. The seed stage investor got their large ownership position. They did get to maintain their $1 million liquidation preference. The series A investor, they're happy because they have five million liquidation preference and the other investor only has a million, like it should be. Like what everyone invested. And the founder's happy because now there's only $6 million of liquidation preference sitting in front of them instead of ten. \n\nSo it's fair to everybody, but the bottom line for the seed investor is they took a risk early on, investing in a low valuation and now they have 20% ownership in probably a really fast-growing company that just raised around $25 million. So this is why you would see a convertible note or SAFE note split out when it converts into partial common stock and partial preferred. It's a little technical but I hope this helps. \n\nIt's a question we get quite a bit from founders and so if you have questions, just shoot us an email and we'll answer the super detailed question you probably have. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "What is a Convertible Note Valuation Cap?\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today we're talking about what is a convertible note valuation cap? \n\nAnd, you know, when people invest money via a convertible note into a startup, it's typically a angel pre-seed, seed rounds. They're really looking for the big upside that comes over time when the company's gonna IPO or get bought for a lot of money, five, 10 years from now. And so no one would give startup founders money if it was just a pure debt return, like a five or 10% return because you wouldn't make enough money as an investor and you'd be out of business really quickly. So they really do it for the equity upside and the way to determine the equity entry point and then thereby the equity upside is by the valuation cap. \n\nSo you've got a bunch of other items that you're negotiating the convertible debt, and I've covered that in other videos, but here we're just talking about essentially the equity, the convertible valuation. And so for example, you might invest in a seed-stage company at a $10,000,000 cap. That's the lingo that people use. That means if another round of capital, usually institutional VC, comes in with a Series A and does the round at 20, 30, $40,000,000 valuation, your cost basis for that equity is $10,000,000, and you can kind of see how it works, like you've given the angel investor a really strong incentive to come in early because they know that even though they're gonna lose some of these, they're gonna get in a lot earlier than some of the institutional VCs. \n\nAnd, therefore, their return profile is actually a lot higher. On the ones they invest in early, they can make a lot, a lot of money. And so the convertible cap is heavily negotiated. It's something you're probably gonna do if you're a founder with like your lead investor. It may be a pre-seed or seed fund or maybe it's just a high net worth person who's kind of taking the lead and putting up the bulk of the capital. You'll negotiate this with them. You know, at pre-seed we usually see kind of five, $6,000,000 caps. \n\nAt seed, it's 10, $15,000,000. Maybe 20. That's pretty aggressive. And then if you're doing something kind of before, you know, a Series A is kicking off, just trying to squeeze some money into a company, you might see a 20 or $30,000,000 cap. The cap is negotiable. So you could do a cap at a $50,000,000 valuation or a $100,000,000 valuation. It happens, but that is something that's negotiated between you and the investor. So I hope that helps. You know, angel, seed, you know, startup investing is very difficult, and so getting in at a low entry point for investors is really important and making sure they make enough money on the winners is really important. \n\nAnd so that negotiation on the value cap, valuation cap, and what that valuation is gonna effectively be in the future is really, really important. So good luck. Hopefully it's a collegial conversation. If it's not collegial, probably not a good partner for your startup long-term, so hopefully you find someone nice, easy to work with, and who believes in your vision. That is really, really important. If you have any questions on this, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com. Thank you so much. Bye.",

Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm talking about what is a convertible note investment? \n\nAnd really convertible notes exist as a mechanism, or security, so that angels and seed and pre-seed investors can put money into startups. So the documentation is clear and clean, everyone knows what terms they're getting, and hey, the startup that's gonna go on and change the world gets capital, they get to build their company. \n\nAnd so, there's a couple of different ways of investing in a startup. Sometimes it's preferred stock, very rarely it's common stock. That's usually what the management team owns. Sometimes it's a SAFE note which is a Y Combinator kind of innovation a few years ago. But old, old steady, tried and true is the convertible note. And that's been around for a very long time. \n\nAnd it's got very specific terms, it's got the amount, the length of term, the conversion cap. Those are kind of the big ones, interest rate, it's gonna be nominal. But it is a tool to get money into startups and help those founders change the world. \n\nAnd so, it's kinda that simple. When you raise money as a startup and you're very early stage, you're either gonna raise it in a convertible note, or you're gonna raise it in a SAFE note.

Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're going over a sample convertible note agreement. \n\nNow we're going to provide one here for you, but your law firm will have this too. And I generally believe that you should just work with the law firm's template. They're gonna be the ones who document the deal, use their template. But this is helpful from an informational standpoint, this will actually teach you a lot. \n\nAnd, you'll notice, the amount is in there. That's super important. The term when the money basically has to be paid back or the note needs to be extended is a really important one. The valuation cap, super important. We've gone over that in a couple different videos. And then you're also gonna have the portion about whether it's converting to common or preferred. Most of the time, especially if you have institutional VCs, always gonna be preferred. But just scan through this convertible note template. You'll see, it's not very long. You can have a one or two page, not one probably two to three page convertible note template. That's very easy to document. That's why people like it. It's really cheap and easy to do a convertible note investment. \n\nAnd that's good for the startup they're not wasting a lot of money on legal fees. It's good for the investors because it's easy to understand. They can make the investment with confidence. Also, investing in startups a little bit like falling in love, sometimes it's impulsive. So being able to do it quickly and get it documented is very, very helpful for both parties. Enjoy the template, again don't be afraid to reach out to your lawyer. A lot of law firms have really good online presences now, too where, you know, Wilson, Cooley, Orrick, a lot of them have their stuff up on the internet where you can just do that. \n\nAnd then there's other services like Clerky that have templates. I think Stripe Atlas might have one. So you'll see a lot of stuff around, but enjoy and hopefully this answers most of your questions.

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're answering the question, why don't VCs like to lead down rounds? \n\nAnd the reason why this question is popping up a lot is with COVID and the associated economic fallout, there's a lot of pressure on valuations and raising money has gotten a lot harder than it's been over the last couple of years. And so, some entrepreneurs are being faced with down rounds or maybe just contemplating them, and what does that mean for the company? Well, there's one thing that's super important to know, and that's, VCs actually don't like leading down rounds. \n\nAnd there's a couple reasons for that. First of all, and I'm talking about outside VCs, not VCs that are already invested in the company. VCs that are invested in the company, they will typically do a bridge round, they'll help the company get through, that's part of being a good VC and part of being a good board member. But sometimes those VCs are tapped out, and so the entrepreneur has to look to an outside VC to lead a round. And there're some reasons why outside VCs don't like to do it. The first is, it can really make your referral network as a VC mad. \n\nPeople generally know this, but VCs refer each other deals. So, a top-tier series A investor, I always like to say has series B and series C investors on their speed dial. They have five funds that they really like to work with. And so if those funds were to kind of come at their companies in an opportunistic way to try to lead down rounds and wash out those series A investors, well, that's ruining the relationship there. So those series B, series C investors are very aware of that. And so they gently gracefully bow out of most down round opportunities. \n\nThe second reason is that the follow-on investors actually know that VC firms force rank their companies. And the VC firms know their top companies. And so they're always gonna support the top companies in the portfolio. So, if you're a later investor and you're getting the opportunity to lead a down round, well, that means it's probably not the greatest situation, it's not in the top 50% of that other VC fund's investment. So, that makes you worried a little bit again. \n\nAnd the third reason is, it can be a huge waste of time, because a lot of these times, the internal VCs are just looking for a fairer price. They've been negotiating a down round or inside round with the founder, but no one knows how to price it. And so by getting an outside investor to put a price on the round, you've done the job that everyone's looking for. They can get the term sheet, they know what the price is, but that doesn't mean they have to sign the term sheet and actually take the money. \n\nOftentimes what I see is, the internal VCs will just do the round at that price. That means the outside VC has done a ton of due diligence, risks making their referral network mad, and for what do they get out of it? Nothing, they don't even get the deal. \n\nSo those are three reasons why VCs don't like doing down rounds. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "When is IRS Form 5471 due?\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're answering the question: When is IRS form 5471 due? And for those that don't know, 5471 is an informational return that needs to be included in your company's tax return. \n\nI'm speaking about Delaware C Corps right now that's our main focus at Kruze Consulting. So, your Delaware C Corp return that goes in to the IRS will have, basically, like an extra form on it, 5471, which covers your foreign corporation, which basically means if you have a foreign subsidiary, like maybe you have a development team in Argentina, or a sales team in London, England, or some other entity somewhere across the world, you need to tell the IRS that you have the entity. And you're basically going to supply the IRS with your financial statements from that entity. It helps the IRS track where all this cash is going across the world, helps them kind of root out bad actors. You know, people who might set up a corporation or a subsidiary for some not so great purposes. \n\nAnd so, it's a really, it's kind of your civic duty as someone who has incorporated and running a company to do if you have a foreign corporation. The fine for not filing it is really large. It's $20,000 per year, per form, so definitely, definitely file that 5471. Unfortunately, you see sometimes, you know, companies are incorporated by foreign founders who don't actually know about this. So please, please do that. There's a similar form called the 5472, which I'll cover in another video, that applies to foreign owners that needs to be disclosed, too. But the 5471 goes alongside or in your tax returns. So, the kind of headline due date is April 15th give or take a day every year, the typical tax return due date. \n\nNow, a lot of people know this, but you can actually file a tax extension form with the IRS. And especially when your company is losing money, you file that form, and the tax return and the 5471 become due on October 15th or within a day or so of that depending on if it's a weekend or not every year. Now, I make that distinction about a money-losing company because you don't owe estimated taxes if you're losing money as a company. If you're profitable, you file an extension. You do have to make your estimated tax payments. \n\nAt Kruze, we work with tons of startups. We do have some profitable startups. So, we have clients that do those estimated tax payments, but the vast majority are startups who are losing money still, building their product, haven't achieved cashflow positive or profits, and so it's very easy for them to extend. And we extend everyone really. So, the due date is April 15th for the 5471. But if you file that extension, it will be October 15th. So, and again, in the given year, you may have like a weekend where it lands on October 15th. And so, usually the IRS will kick it to the next Monday. So you might look at like, it might be like October 17th in a given year. So, I hope that helps! Hit us up if you have any questions, 5471s are very, very important. \n\nMake sure your startup tax preparer actually knows how to fill them out and knows how to do them right. And be diligent! You don't want to get one of those $20,000 fines. Hope that helps! Hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com if you have any other questions. Thanks!",

      "description": "IRS Form 5472 for Foreign Shareholders\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today we're talking about IRS Form 5472. And this is for foreign shareholders, specifically, for individuals or corporations that own over 25% of the ownership of a startup. \n\nAnd so, you normally see this when like, maybe two founders incorporate and one owns 50%, the other owns 50%, and but one of them is foreign. And so you actually have to file this 5472. The other use case is like maybe a corporation made a 25% investment or spun a technology out into a startup and owns over 25%. Regardless of it, if they own over 25%, they have to file Form 5472 with their regular tax return. So this goes kind of like think about it like stapling on top of an 1120, which is the annual tax return for companies, for corporations. You can't file the 5472 by itself. It needs to go in with the 1120. These days almost everyone files their taxes electronically. So it's just another form that your tax preparer, your friendly CPA, Kruze Consulting, will help you file and do for you. Now, if you don't do it, like say you're not aware of the law or something like that, it's a $20,000 fine per year, per form. \n\nSo it's really, really painful, that I see this sometimes where it's like some founders incorporate late in the year and they're foreign, they don't have good tax advice and they call us in February and we have to give them the bad news that it needs to be done and they probably owe $20,000. Now there is a process for abating this with the IRS, if it's the first year. So you can petition them, you have to do a bunch of calls, it takes a really long time, but it is possible to get abated. It doesn't happen every single time, but that is an option. \n\nSo tell your friendly CPA, Kruze, or whoever else you're using that is an option that can be done. This is like one of those things where people ask us all the time, like why should I work with a professional CPA firm that knows startups really well versus like, you know, the CPA with a shingle down the block on, you know, whatever street in mid America. And this is one of the things, like the average CPA, isn't gonna be very well-versed in things like foreign shareholders or foreign subsidiaries or R&D Tax Credits, but someone like us who focuses on venture-backed startups constantly is gonna pick this up very quickly and know what you need to do. So this is kind of what you're, you know, was one of the reasons why people choose to work with Kruze. The other thing about the 5472, it's gonna have, like, the vital statistics of the firm, a VOC Corp and the foreign person, so like a lot of times, it's like transactions between the two, like payroll, loans, sales, anything like that, that has to be included on the 5472 as well. \n\nAnd then it's good to know that, you know, this again, this is due with the 1120 Form that's due on April 15th, but you can file an extension. And we file an extension automatically for every one of our clients, just in case there's a mess up somewhere. And with an extension filed in a regular year, it's October 15th. So I'm recording this September 30th. So we're two weeks away from the tax deadline. But the most important thing is don't forget this, tell your tax preparer, tell your CPA, if you do own more than 25% of a corporation or you have a strategic investor who owns 25% or more than 25%. \n\nIt's a big deal, you don't want that $20,000 fine, and something that's easily avoided if you have a good tax CPA. Hope that helps, thanks!",

      "description": "Does a Contractor trigger Tax Nexus in a State?\n\nLooking for advice setting up your startup’s HR, finance, and payroll infrastructure? Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health\n\nHey it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question, does a contractor trigger tax nexus in a state? \n\nNow tax nexus is actually two things. It's income tax and sales tax. Now luckily for our purposes on this question, it's the same answer. A contractor does not trigger tax nexus within a state. Now, the things that do are if you have actual employees, employees you need to register to do business in the state, you have to register to do payroll taxes, that does trigger tax nexus. The other things are if you have equipment like capital assets, like things like computers, big heavy production machinery, things like that. \n\nAlso if you have property, if you're leasing or buying property that can trigger tax nexus. And the final thing is income or material amounts of sales. Both of those will trigger tax nexus within a state. Now the sales threshold is different across different states. And there was a really, couple of years ago, a new ruling called Wayfair versus South Dakota, where actually the state of South Dakota won a ruling that said they could start charging sales tax on companies that didn't have a presence in the state, but sold online. \n\nYou can imagine how the states felt. A bunch of their constituents were buying stuff from out-of-state online retailers, and they weren't getting their fair share of the sales tax. So they took that to the Supreme Court, Supreme Court sided with them, and so now when online retailers actually spent or sell a material amount of goods or services into a state, even if they don't have a presence, they do have to collect sales tax. \n\nSo to bring us all the way back, if you have a contractor in the state, that does not trigger tax nexus, but there's a few other things that do, like people and like employees, capital assets, property or material amounts of income or sales. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

And today we're talking about How long does it take for Gusto to handle your startup payroll tax issue? \n\nNow, one of the things we love about Gusto is they handle payroll tax issues. They're super messy. They're super hard. No one likes touching payroll tax issues. But Gusto will help you do it. They have a team of dedicated people that only do this. And by the way, I know how expensive that is because Kruze Consulting has its own dedicated team of tax professionals. If your bookkeeping firm doesn't have tax in-house, a dedicated team, that's a huge red flag. So be super careful about that. Now, Gusto is great because they work with our tax team and our account managers to fix all these payroll tax issues that our startups sometimes have. \n\nNow, how long does it take? Well, if you're on the Concierge Plan, which is their higher end plan, they'll assign someone in one week, which is really nice. On the Core Plan, which is their lower end plan, it's something like two to three weeks. You love it to be a little sooner. But hey again, we know how expensive having these tax professionals on staff is. So hey, we can live with it. \n\nNow it's usually going to take them another week or two to completely solve the issue. If it's not like an easy one. Sometimes you get payroll tax notices that are more informational than actual issues. So again, Gusto is fantastic about this. They have a team of dedicated tax professionals on staff. Core: it's going to be two, three weeks for assignment and then another one or two weeks to solve it. \n\nConcierge: they'll get you someone within one week, which is nice really fast,. And it'll probably take, again, another week or two to fix everything. \n\nHope that helps on how long does it take Gusto to solve my startup's payroll tax issue. Thanks.",

      "title": "State Payroll Tax Registrations - does your startup need to worry about them?",
      "description": "State Payroll Tax Registrations - does your startup need to worry about them?\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nThere's really kind of three things that go into state registrations in general. Like you hire someone in another state, you need to register with the governments there. But there's three kind of concepts. The first is a state registration to do business there. Sometimes that's called like a foreign corporation filing. The second one is filing for a state payroll tax account. And the third one is what's called a registered agent. \n\nAnd again, people sometimes get confused with this, because, hey, it's not like you, if you're building a technology company, you're not sitting up at night studying like state law. You're sitting up at night studying code or molecular diagnostics or something super interesting. So that's why we're here, to explain this stuff to you. So, the first thing you need to know is when you do hire someone in another state, or start conducting business in another state, over some revenue thresholds or things like that, or of assets. You will have to file to do business in that state. \n\nAnd so you essentially in California, you know, it's a very simple filing with covering whatever tax. You pay a couple hundred bucks then every year you pay $800 for your franchise tax filing. But you basically need to let the state know that you are in their state and you are conducting business. And California is the most expensive state annual tax for this. A lot of states are like, you know, 50 bucks, 200 bucks, something like that. They really just want to be able to monitor you and collect some nominal amount of taxes. Remember, the states get revenue in a couple of different ways. And the state registrations or state filings is one of those ways. \n\nSo, no matter where you go, you're gonna have to register in that state. And don't get too cute and not register, but then have people in that state because you're violating tax nexus. You also get tripped up a lot on your annual tax return. Because if you have people in the state, you've registered in that state, you should be filing a state tax return along with the federal tax return. Like the one that goes to the IRS. People get a little bit confused about this, but just do the right thing, register in the state when you start working there. The next thing you're gonna do is you're gonna have to register and create a state payroll tax account. \n\nNow, a few states, the registration and payroll tax account are joined. But almost all the states besides a couple, you're gonna have to create separate account. It's just like they're governed by different bodies. They care about different things. Still, both are pretty easy. And the state payroll tax account is what you need when you're gonna start hiring people and paying them through payroll. So you are gonna take that special number they give you, which is, you know, attached to your company in the records. You're gonna pop that into your payroll tax software. \n\nWhich is gonna let you take out the appropriate amount of payroll taxes for the employee in that state, you'll find that a lot of payroll systems like, you know, Rippling and Gusto, Justworks, TriNet, less Justworks and TriNet because they're PEOs, they'll handle some of those for you, but Rippling and Gusto, they will sometimes block your payroll for that person until you get that payroll tax number. And the reason why is, they know that person's out of state or in another state, but they don't have a way of remitting the payroll taxes they withheld to the correct state government. They don't have a way or an account. That makes it really complicated for them. And it makes it really expensive for them.\n\nThe third thing when I talked about, which is a registered agent, this is typically related, I only bring it up in this category or this video because people get it confused with those other two. But a registered agent is typically applicable to a company that incorporates in Delaware. Delaware's kind of like the home of incorporation, not necessarily where they actually do business, but just they operate under Delaware rules and the reason for that is a venture capitalists and other folks know the case law in Delaware and it's also a business friendly state. \n\nAnd there's a bunch of services that do this. They've kind of virtualized the service and it cost like 100 to 150 bucks a year, but the state of Delaware requires you to have this service because they need someone to be responsible for receiving that paperwork. \n\nHit us up at kruzeconsulting.com if you have any other questions on state payroll tax and state registrations, happy to help.

      "description": "What is a Professional Employment Organization (PEO)?\n\nLooking for advice setting up your startup’s HR, finance, and payroll infrastructure? Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today's I'm answering the question, what is a PEO, better known as a professional employer organization? \n\nAnd PEOs were an innovation, probably like 15, 20 years ago where some very smart folks, including TriNet, figured out that you could actually pool employees and if you pool employees, you actually create a lot of buying power. And so the pooling mechanism is basically, the employees of a startup actually work directly for the professional employer organization, the PEO, and then have kind of like a side relationship with the startup. But because the PEO can roll up thousands and thousands and thousands of employees because they're working with so many different startups and companies, they actually get a lot of buying power and that buying power actually rivals with some of the other big Fortune 500 companies. \n\nSo like I know some of the PEOs say like hey, you can get Fortune 500 benefits and the quality of benefits and the inexpensiveness of benefits by working through a PEO. So PEOs actually become really popular in the COVID times because people are very sensitive about their benefits and really care about that and so providing great benefits is really important. And secondly, PEOs will actually handle some of the local state tax compliance because you're effectively working for them and so they have an incentive to handle that stuff for you. So it's kind nice. It takes it off your plate. This is especially important when like your employee base is maybe moving spreading out from San Francisco to New York, LA, those typical startup places and moving to lots of states in the Midwest or the South because they can have a better lifestyle there or they wanna be next to family, things like that. \n\nSo when people start moving into a lot of other states that work at your company, it starts creating tax nexus problems and you have to start registering it to do business or registering to do payroll taxes in that state. If you're working with a PEO, they actually basically virtualize that and make it super simple for you. So you don't have to worry about it. So it's a pretty great combo. I would say that the only negative is that it's significantly more expensive than just kind of your regular payroll and benefits setup. \n\nSo the PEO does allow for cheaper benefits but the monthly subscription fee per employee is actually substantially higher than the alternatives. So you're kinda, the way I would think about it, I'll probably date myself here but you're paying for a Cadillac service or you're paying for the Neiman Marcus service rather than shopping at Target or something like that. But it's an option that a lot of startups are doing right now in COVID times because again, the complexity of managing your employee base and what states they're in has actually become a lot more difficult. \n\nAnd so the PEO virtualizes all that and handles that for you, so I wanted to just do this video so everyone understood what a PEO is, a professional employer organization 'cause I'm getting this question like every day, so I thought I'd help everyone out and record a quick video on it. Hope this helps, thanks.",

      "description": "Should your startup use a convertible note, SAFE, or preferred stock?\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nThe basic trade off you're making when you raise money as a founder is you're giving someone ownership in your company via a lot of expensive legal paperwork and you're getting cash in the door, right? And so, picking the security that you're giving the investors, whether that's the preferred stock, the SAFE note, the convertible debt, is actually important. You want to be thoughtful about this and make a good decision. So I've done videos explaining what convertible debt is, what SAFE notes are, what preferred equity is or are, so check those videos out. But I'm going to give you the CliffNotes reasons why certain parties actually like different types of securities. So for preferred equity, that is a favorite of venture capitalists. \n\nAnd so, the price per share in preferred equity is defined. You know you're paying a dollar a share, and when you add up all the shares in the company, you times that by a dollar and that's the valuation of the company, right? Very, very clear. There's no conversion feature to be had later, which is the case with SAFE notes and convertible notes, which I'll talk about in a second. It's plain as day what you're paying and what the valuation of the company is at the time of the deal. It also starts the QSBS clock immediately. QSBS is frankly a tax shelter or a way of mitigating your capital gains taxes down the line if the startup qualifies. And I think there's like kind of five main qualifications. I've done that in another video, you can check that out, but QSBS can save up to $10 million, or I think it's 15X; don't quote me on that, of whatever the investors' base is, shelter that from capital gains taxes. \n\nBut guess what? The IRS hasn't clarified whether that actually works or not. So we're all going to find out in a couple of years, because SAFE notes have been popular for awhile, whether the IRS actually recognizes that as the date of the clock starting. So that'll be a fun little surprise and I'll definitely do videos on that whenever they come out with a ruling. But next up, the reason why investors like preferred stock is there's a liquidation preference, typically 1X, but very clearly defined. And that means that they get their money back, their invested capital back, before the common stock starts to participate. \n\nNow, preferred equity can always be converted into common later on. And that's what happens when a company does an IPO. The night before the IPO when it starts trading on the NASDAQ or New York Stock Exchange, all the investors typically will convert over, assuming it makes sense economically for them. \n\nThe only big material difference is that convertible debt is redeemable, typically kind of like every 20, 24 months, sometimes even 36 months. SAFE notes are not really typically redeemable. \n\nAnd that works for the founders because they got the capital they needed at the time where they probably didn't have a lot to show for it. So the cap is kind of a proxy for valuation. This is all finalized later when another round, typically a preferred round comes in and there's a clear valuation. The cap is probably the most important term in a SAFE note and convertible debt. Again, SAFE notes and convertible debt, much, much, faster and cheaper to negotiate. They're usually like a two or three page document. A preferred document can be significantly longer, 20, 30 pages, something like that.   \n\nThis happens quite a bit. The round might start at a $10 million cap. Some other investors put their money at 15, and then someone late puts money at 25. It's hard to keep all those dilution events in sync in your head, and it's also kind of hard to frankly model it out. There are tools like cap table management software that can help you model it. But even those are a little tricky when there's multiple notes or SAFE notes, convertible debt interacting with each other because it's kind of like a circular calculation. If anyone's ever done a lot of Excel, circular calculations can be a little maddening. So SAFE notes, convertible debt are not perfect. \n\nThere's some downsides with them too. Generally, I recommend early stage companies do the SAFE or converts because they're cheap, they're fast and easy. You can kind of get them done quickly. But if you're raising a material amount of money, like a lot of money, I would always go for a preferred round. It's just easier to get it documented correctly.",

      "description": "Do SAFE Notes start the QSBS Holding Period Clock?\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question, do SAFE notes in an investment, in startups start the QSBS holding period clock? And so I'm going to give you a brief summary of QSBS, which is one of the, kind of the last remaining. I don't know, I don't know what to call it, tax shelters out there in the world. \n\nAnd basically it says that, if you own stock in a corporation, that's in like a very highly specific engineering technology focused industry, and you hold that stock for five years and there's a few other requirements. You can actually shield $10 million of capital gains or 10X your investment in capital gains, and you don't pay taxes on that shield. So it can be a really material amount of savings for people who have like a $10 million gain, on a huge startup outcome, especially general partners at venture capital firms. They think about this a lot, the normal founders and normal angel investors, yes, everyone cares about QSBS but the VCs are professional investors. It's something they think about quite a bit. And so, but it's important. \n\nIt can actually save you a lot of money. And so there's been a lot of focus lately on this five-year holding period, and whether SAFE notes, which is kind of like a relatively new innovation in startup financing, maybe like five years old, it's kind of like a hybrid between common and convertible debt, if that actually qualifies to start the clock and the punchline is no one actually knows. And the reason is the IRS hasn't really clarified their position, really on QSBS, much at all, qualified small business stock. They haven't really clarified much at all, but they certainly haven't clarified SAFE notes. \n\nAnd so what we've seen over kind of last, I'd probably say like nine months, maybe last year, is the big law firms that service startups and some of the big incubators like Y Combinator, are now inserting a clause in the SAFE note documents saying something to the effect of, that for tax purposes, the safe note is to be treated as common stock. And the QSBS clock should start immediately upon execution of this. So basically everyone kind of is asserting that SAFE notes are equivalent to common stock, in which case the five-year holding period of the clock would start. But the reality is no one really knows this. There's been no kind of full ruling on this. And so everyone's playing in this gray area. Now there's especially like the way the stock market and acquisitions and outcomes are happening right now. \n\nI fully expect the IRS to clarify this or test it in litigation. So we'll probably know relatively soon, I'm recording this in late September 2021, but there isn't as much guidance as you'd like. So for purposes of the advice I would give a startup or a venture capitalist is, everyone should make best efforts, which is kind of like legal language for like doing the best you can, but you're not guaranteeing anything. A startup should always be careful in guaranteeing or what's called repping, representation warranties, that they are 100% QSBS compliant, because you just never know if something could go wrong or there was redemption that violates that. \n\nAnd then you open yourself up to litigation. So always stick to best efforts. But, you know, I think it's, I think the law firms and incubators and some of the VCs are doing the right thing by inserting this clarification into the documentation. We just don't know if the IRS is going to recognize that we won't know it probably for a couple of years, but eventually they'll get around to clarifying. So I hope that helps. \n\nAnd if you have other questions on this or other stock or SAFE notes or convertible debt questions, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com, we're here to help you.

And today I want to take a little bit more time to talk to you about the R&D tax credits. Specifically, what defines research and development? \n\nAnd the answer is it must pass the IRS's four-part test. So, in other words, your R&D must be One: Specific. So, there's no mindless tinkering allowed. \n\nSecond: It must eliminate uncertainty. That means that you must be contributing to real scientific advancement not just proving existing knowledge. \n\nThird: It must be experimental. Either you have a scientific method or some sort of trial and error process. And last but not least it must be technical. That means that the work needs to be grounded in the sciences like biology or engineering, not the arts or literature. \n\nThanks for watching. I'm Vanessa and please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.",

      "description": "Best SaaS Accounting Software\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nI always say Quickbooks was kind of like the sun in the solar system. Everything rotates around QuickBooks. But there's other really good accounting software so, a competitor to QuickBooks is Xero, which is super popular in Asia, Australia, New Zealand, because it's a New Zealand founded company. In Europe it's very popular, not as popular in the United States, but Xero is really kind of the first scalable cloud accounting software. And I think they kind of put the fear of God into QuickBooks and made QuickBooks invest a lot of money and expertise into QuickBooks Online and make it, get it to parity. \n\nBut Xero is a perfectly fine software for early stage companies. We don't really recommend starting with it because we're gonna probably transition you to QuickBooks anyways, but if you're a three or four person company, Xero's perfectly fine. \n\nNetSuite is the typical migration path for a company on QuickBooks. As the company gets to 10 or $15 million in revenue or starts consulting international entities like an international subsidiary, it makes the accounting a lot easier for that. NetSuite is very robust, you can be a public company on NetSuite. Does tons of different modules, does a lot of different stuff for you. NetSuite typically competes directly with Intact.\n\nAnd probably, I'd say most famously is Brex and we've been a partner of Brex for probably four years, since Michael Tannenbaum walked into our office and said, we've got to work together, shout out to Michael. And what Brex does very well is integrate into QuickBooks and automate again, some of that categorization and labeling. It also has no personal guarantee. They will do some pretty aggressive, effectively letting you borrow money on a Brex credit card. But we like it because it's really easy to use, integrates well, no personal guarantee. And they are building a bill pay system inside of Brex because what typically we were seeing was a company would sign up with Brex and then they'd also go to Bill.com. Bill.com is very good for paying invoices, paying vendors, through wires or ACH or electronic payments. Not as much a credit card company, until they bought Divvy a couple of weeks ago, as I'm recording this, which is kind of like a Brex competitor. \n\nAdditional Brex competitors would be Ramp who's like a credit card based system that tries to manage your spend control, having a lot of success, building up their customer base. And then Airbase is a super interesting company in that category because Airbase came at this less as a credit card company, and more as a spend management company. Kind of think like they're the enterprise software solution to this marketplace. They do offer cards and make provisioning and controlling expense levels on cards very easy, but that's not the foundation of their business, like Brex, Divvy, Ramp, right? But all of these categories are converging. And what I think is gonna happen, and we've been saying this for years and talking to all of our partners about this, is this all gonna be in one system? So like a startup will just be on Brex or they'll be on the Bill.com Divvy Combo. Or they'll be on Ramp, or they'll be on Airbase. \n\nAnd now Expensify is coming out with a bunch of different stuff. So they're in that exact market, too. So there's kind of like five big competitors who are well-funded. All have actually really upped their game in the software stack and we have relationships with all of them. We do a lot of business with all of them. It's a little bit of fragmented market right now, so it's hard to tell exactly who's gonna win. For me, I love the ease of just setting up a Brex credit card and getting that going. If you're looking for the pure big spend management tool, I would go with Airbase out of the box. They're moving down market. They've had a lot of success with the series C, series D companies. \n\nAnd then again, Ramp and Divvy, Bill.com are also excellent tools. So you're not really gonna go wrong with some of the players in this market. We talked about the pure play credit card market players. I expect the Amex's and Chase's of the world will either buy companies, like Chase put a really large investment into FreshBooks, which is an accounting platform I should have probably mentioned in the earlier segment, as kind of their place holder. \n\nAnd frankly, riding the cost curves down of these tools, is really exciting, especially if you're on a fixed fee because you just get more and more efficient over time and everybody wins. So those are my favorite SaaS accounting tools. I hope that helps, if you have any other questions, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com. I've probably done videos on almost all those.",

And it looks like they're gonna have to pay a lot of taxes and that's what's causing them to reach out to us. No, your safe note is not taxable. That is an investment, that is not revenue. \n\nAnd so the SAFE note goes on your balance sheet booked as equity. It does not go on your profit and loss statement. You should not be paying taxes on the proceeds of your SAFE notes, and so the SAFE notes are eventually gonna get converted into common or preferred. \n\nAgain not gonna hit your P&L so, this is a quick one but it's a mistake we see a lot from folks who are doing their own financials and there's nothing wrong with doing your own financials we actually encourage that at the very, very early stage companies, who've raised just a little bit of money but, if you're, you know, raised $500k or a million dollars you're starting to get to the point where you can afford to buy back a little bit your time and make sure your financials and your taxes are done properly and we're always here to answer your questions but this is one that you don't wanna mess up because if you treat those SAFE notes as revenue you're gonna end up paying a lot of taxes that you shouldn't have paid.

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're talking about the importance of having a bookkeeper who can handle your sales tax. \n\nNow, you may think this is like a skill across the bookkeeping world, but it's not. There's a lot of not-so-great bookkeepers out there who have no clue on this stuff, so, let's save you some time and some pain here. So if you don't have a bookkeeper who knows how to handle sales tax, it's pretty likely that you're gonna end up paying sales tax out of your own pocket because your company isn't actually collecting it from its customers. So that's like lost cash right there. The other way a bookkeeper can mess this up if they're not sophisticated, is that they could let you collect the sales tax, but then not remit it to the states or local governments, which becomes a really big issue; that's actually a crime. So you do not wanna be committing crimes while you're building your startup, so don't mess around with this stuff. \n\nNow this has become actually even more important because the Supreme Court ruled in favor of South Dakota v. Wayfair a couple years ago, and basically South Dakota's argument was like, hey, a bunch of our people in South Dakota are transacting with this Wayfair ecommerce site, but Wayfair is not remitting any sales tax to us. And Wayfair's argument was they didn't have nexus. They didn't have people, property, or assets inside of South Dakota, so why pay sales tax? And so what the Supreme Court did is said like, hey, South Dakota is due some of these taxes. \n\nSo after a threshold, like 100K is passed in sales within the state, the state can start taxing it. So this kinda upped the ante and made sales tax even more important on a state-by-state basis. And I think the other thing you gotta remember is there's SaaS sales tax in a lot of states, not all of them, but this is actually becoming... This is, I think, gonna be one of those things, like ecommerce sales tax and SaaS sales tax, which the governments look to help close their budget deficits. We're in the middle of COVID right now. All the governments' budgets are just totally blown, and so they're gonna be looking for incremental revenue opportunities. And so sales tax is actually gonna become a lot more important going forward. \n\nSo don't mess around, work with a firm, ideally like us that has a dedicated sales tax team, and that's embedded in our general tax-dedicated team. If you're working with someone who's outsourcing taxes, be really, really careful. That can have problems with your federal state returns, but on the sales tax side, it's almost guaranteed they're not gonna be able to handle your sales tax correctly. \n\nSo just be careful. Pick a good bookkeeper who understands sales tax. You'll be safe, you won't make these mistakes, and you can just focus on running your startup. Hope that helps!",

      "description": "Economic Nexus & Sales Tax\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today I'm talking about economic nexus and sales tax. \n\nNow economic nexus is a fairly new term actually. That's why we're doing a video on it. It used to be the ways to establish nexus, which basically means like the requirement to pay taxes, was you looked in a state and you said, \"Does the company have people? Does it have assets? Or does it have property?\" If it has any of those three things, the company has tax nexus in that state, but a couple years ago along came a Supreme Court ruling on the Wayfair versus South Dakota case. \n\nAnd that established the concept of economic nexus, which basically means like, \"Hey, even though the company doesn't have people, doesn't have assets, doesn't have property in that state, they're selling a lot of goods or services to the people of that state. They're doing business in that state, even though they don't have a physical presence.\" \n\nAnd so the Supreme Court ruled that states could actually tax on the basis of economic nexus, which opened up sales tax really kind of for the whole country, especially for like e-commerce companies, especially for retailers, especially for SaaS companies. And economic nexus is kind of like the fancy term that basically says like, \"Hey, if you're doing $50,000, $100,000, some material amount of sales in a state, you are creating economic nexus.\" You have to file sales tax returns. \n\nYou most likely have to file a state tax return along with your federal return for income tax as well. So I hope this helps. Economic nexus is just it's something that maybe accountants talk about, and I'm recording this video because you, as a startup founder, may be talking to your accountant, hopefully you're talking to Kruze, the friendly CPA, and you don't know the definition of that. And so I don't want you to be confused. And so economic nexus just basically means doing business in a state, even though you don't have a physical presence, and surpassing some dollar amount of revenue threshold that the state has set. And the states are all over the place. \n\nThere's 50 states in the union, right? So they all have different thresholds, but 50 to 100K is a really good kind of barometer. At that point, start talking to your CPA firm. Ask Kruze, we have a full sales tax team, in-house tax team, do tons of this kind of stuff. Hit us up, we'll answer your questions. And I hope that helps, thanks.",

      "description": "How the stock option pool at the Series A impacts a Founder’s ownership\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm covering how the stock option pool at series A, impacts a founder's ownership in their startup. \n\nSo venture capitalists are smart. They want the company to have enough stock options that can be issued for new employees that join the company so that they're incentivized for big, big upside. Venture capitalists are only concerned with huge IPO, giant M&A outcomes. That's all they invest for. That's all they want. And so they've found over the years that it's great to incentivize employees a little piece of ownership so that if something goes big, they make a lot of money and the venture capitalist makes a lot of money. And so everyone's aligned. But for you as a founder, if you're listening to this, you just have to know that any dilution, whether it's raising new money from a VC or dilution in the form of issuing or granting new stock options is really going to impact you. Like, you are the source of that dilution. \n\nYou are losing ownership percentage points. And so it's important to be smart about this. So when you sign a series A term sheet, just know before that term sheet closes and turns into like a deal, there will probably be new issuance or new reserves of stock options. The VCs will insist on it. In fact, it will probably be in the term sheet you signed. It'll say something like founder agrees to increase the stock option pool up to 10% or maybe up to 15% of total shares outstanding. And even though those shares are not granted at the time because you really haven't hired those people and you may not hire those people for years, you've essentially reserved those shares. And so you have taken a hit on your ownership. And so how do you think about this? \n\nWell, just remember, this is happening before you actually close the investment and so it's negotiable. It's like everything in life, negotiable. And so when you're choosing the term sheet to sign, you're thinking about, you know, the investor's fund and how smart this investor is and how much the rest of the partners of the fund are going to support you and maybe in branding or content marketing support and maybe recruiting support. But this, alongside the valuation that the investors assign you, is a really important financial negotiating point. So don't be afraid to kind of gently push back and say like, \"Hey, you know, hypothetically you're asking for 15% stock option pool but I think at this stage we can get by with 10%. And oh, by the way, here's my financial model showing exactly the number of people we are going to hire over the next two years. \n\nAnd two years from now, you know, we will raise another round. And yes, we'll probably have to freshen up the option pool then but that's a problem for then, not a problem for now.\" And so say you take that, you know, you negotiate the term sheet from 15% to 10% stock option pool. You've saved yourself as a founder a tremendous amount of dilution. That is, that's meaningful. And the venture capitalists will understand. And they will listen to a well-reasoned argument, especially if it's based in quantitative fact like the financial model. \n\nAnd so having that model ready in those conversations, being willing to understand your cap table and how many of the senior management you've already hired, already given stock options to, and how many, you know, really need to be incentivized in the future when you bring them on in mid-level management is really, really important. But again, I just want to frankly empower the founders out there when you're raising a series A, even the series B this happens. You know, be ready to negotiate. This is a term that you can negotiate. The venture capitalists prefer you to have a bigger option pool because that protects them along the ways. \n\nIt also protects the note holders because they're going to convert at that post-money valuation. But you know, you want to make sure you create enough stock option liquidity to incentivize the team properly but also don't over-allocate it because those are shares you can never get back again. So I hope this helps. \n\nIf you have any other questions on stock options, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com. Happy to answer them. Thanks.",

      "title": "Employer Benefits Contributions for Employees vs. Dependents at Series A Startups",
      "description": "Employer Benefits Contributions for Employees vs. Dependents at Series A Startups\n\nLooking for advice setting up your startup’s HR, finance, and payroll infrastructure? Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health\n\nThe idea is your startup goes out and raises a Series A. Maybe 5, 10, 15, $20 million. Heck, Series A's are getting so big these days. It could be a $30 million, a $40 million Series A. But the question becomes how much of an employer contribution should the company make to pay for the employees' health benefits? So this is like health insurance, vision, dental, all that stuff. And the general rule of thumb is for most well-funded startups, they're gonna wanna pay 100% of the employees' benefits. And that's because they're super well-funded, they've got tons of money, and they're usually competing for like the top engineers in any given field. And if you're trying to recruit people from Google to work at your startup, you're probably gonna have to pay 100% of benefits, right? That's a very quick analogy, but that applies to Genentech. \n\nAnd any big company you're recruiting people away from, they're gonna want really good benefits. Now there's some companies that elect to pay 80, 90% of the benefit expense. And what they're doing there is hoping that the employees make a little bit more of an educated decision on kind of what tier of benefits they go for. So there's usually, like, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze. And so someone who's like super young and healthy, they might elect for Silver or Gold over a Platinum if they're paying 10 or 20% of those benefit costs, right? \n\nSo for Kruze, for example, we have a 401k matching program, where the employees are actually making more, they're actually getting a bigger benefit than what they would be paying than their contribution on the benefits through the matching program. Not everyone does this, but I do recommend making, you know, you can have commuter benefits. You can have short-term and long-term life insurance. Those are things that Kruze does as well for free for our employees. \n\nAnd so there's a lot of different ways that you can kind of make up the money if you are asking employees to make a small contribution to their health benefits. So that's the first part of the answer. The second part of the answer is what do you do about dependents? This is typically spouses, children. And the range there is something between 50, 80, or 100%. Those are the three kind of sticky points that I typically see. 100% is pretty self-explanatory. Again, you are recruiting the top technical talent in the industry, and you really care about getting the best people, and so you might pay 100% of the health benefits of the dependents that are coming along with the employee that you're hiring. \n\nMore frequently, I see 50 to 80% range. Companies typically wanna create, again, a little bit of incentive for the employee to think with their pocketbook a little bit. And if you're hiring the best badass engineer woman, and her husband works at a incredible accounting firm and you want that, before the engineer puts her entire family on your medical benefits plan, which could cost three, four, $5,000 a month extra, you want them to think about what that incremental cost is for them coming out of their pocketbook because maybe the husband at the incredible accounting firm just stays on the accounting firm's benefits because they pay 100% too, right? \n\nAnd so this is a trend in healthcare, is having people make copayments, or having people make small nominal contributions to their benefits, especially health, that's the biggest, most expensive benefit, so that everyone kind of becomes aligned, become like a educated, smart shopper for healthcare instead of just accepting, like, the highest plan and maybe spending the most of the company's money. So I hope that helps. I do wanna emphasize, if you are gonna pay a smaller percentage and let the employee pitch in a little bit, you do wanna try to make that money up to them some way. That's my personal opinion. You don't have to do that. \n\nBut I think it signals to the employee that you really care, that you are making them as successful as possible, you're covering their commuting benefits, or the 401k, so they're saving for the long term. All these things are like, little tiny signals that you can send your employee base because at the end of the day, your startup's only gonna be as successful as the team makes it, and you wanna hire the best and brightest, but you also wanna hire people and make sure their basic needs are taken care of and that they're happy and that they enjoy coming to work and they're not stressed about healthcare payments or commuter expenses or that they're not saving enough money in their 401k.",

We knew their reconciliations, we knew their first RVO, second RVO, and then report up to the VP of finance, or sometimes the controller. \n\nAnd that ends up taking a good 10 or $20,000 worth of costs out of the equation for the company, so we have happy customers, and the accounting quality is still really high, and I get the benefit of that internal resource who's coordinating with the rest of the management team.

Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today we're doing a startup bookkeeping best practice. And one of the most important things a startup bookkeeper can do is. Do a variance analysis on the financials. Once the first pass is done. That means that you're going to look at every line item in the chart of accounts. And just make sure it makes sense. Now we have an automated tool that does that at Kruze. So It goes through and pulls out the stuff that has a higher variance than like 20-25 percent. But a bookkeeper can do that themselves. They can actually look at it and eyeball. So for example, if your payroll expenses have gone up 20-25 percent, the CEO needs to know about it. In our messaging, we actually message that out to the CEO and let them know. Hey, by the way, payroll went up. Now, we usually have a pretty good reason for that. It's usually either a bonus or guess what? They hired a few more team members, which is great. But you always want to call out the variance analysis to the startup CEO so they know exactly what's going on. Similar things around rent or benefits, some of the big expenditures, especially travel. Sometimes the CEO doesn't know that people on the team are booking travel. And guess what? Travel is pretty expensive. So you definitely want to call out the variance analysis on that. Another one is Web services. I've seen times. I'm not going to point fingers, but CIOs or CTOs get a little aggressive with their web service spend. They've got every new web service out there to help the development team. Which is great. Productivity enhancers are great. But sometimes the CEO doesn't know exactly how much money is being spent on that; and being made aware of those big increases when the variance really pops, is super important. And finally, the best way to do a variance analysis is to do budget to actuals every month. We have a huge number of Kruze clients who are doing budget actuals now. It makes so much sense. You sit down with someone on our team. You go over what you are projecting for that month and all the different categories and what you actually did. And having that conversation with a real CPA, a real controller, a real V.P. of finance, is incredibly powerful. You learn so much about your business as a CEO. You know, you're spending money, you know where you need it cut. So we are huge fans of variance analysis and startup bookkeeping. Definitely, start doing that. And if you want to go up a level, do budget to actuals. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

Now, that's temporary, and we're recording this in the summer of 2020, and so, I kind of expect if COVID, hopefully COVID ends soon, but if it continues to go, I think somewhere around January of the next year, some of the states may come out and say, hey, we want those payroll taxes. We want those annual registration fees, so we're going to start making you register when you have employees living in our state, so definitely keep a careful watch on this. So now we're going, so that's COVID. Now, we're going to cover just kind of the normal playbook so that you know how to do this regardless, and I know for us, we have employees that are moving to New York or Texas permanently, so we need to make these moves here and be in tax compliance, so the first thing you're gonna do is when someone moves into a state, they're essentially creating tax nexus for your company because you have an employee there, and you typically have assets, even if it's just like a laptop. That counts as an asset. Now, the other tax nexus trigger is sales. Like if you have a lot of sales in a state, that can be triggering tax nexus, too, but the big ones to focus on right now are assets and employees, so when you have someone move into another state, you need to register to do business in that state, and you'll typically pay like an annual fee every year. In California, it is the California franchise tax. New York has a franchise tax. Texas has an annual tax. Massachusetts has an annual tax. You'll pay that, and then you will typically register new paid payroll taxes with another entity. This is super important because you can't run payroll through a system like Rippling or Gusto until you get those payroll tax numbers. It can actually block your autopilot payroll. So always remember not just to register to do business, but register and pay payroll taxes. You need to get those tax rates, and have the right accounts set up. Another thing you would need to worry about potentially, especially if you moved to somewhere like New York, that employee is going to trigger a nexus, and you're going to have to do worker's comp. and just a few states are state administrative workers comp., but New York is one of those, so just be aware of that. We have companies, they have employees move to New York. They don't know, and we don't know they actually moved there, and they trigger worker's comp. problems. So just be aware of that. The other thing you're going to have to do, start filing a state annual tax return. Now, this goes alongside your federal tax return, and luckily, a lot of the information flows from the federal return, so it's not that much more work, but just know if you trigger tax nexus, you're going to have to file the annual state tax return in the states that you have these employees. Now, this is super duper important because you don't want to forget to file and then  have like back taxes or not be compliant, and you do have to file tax returns even if you're losing money, both on the federal level and the state level. Both the IRS and the state tax commissions, they just want to know what your company is doing. They want to make sure that you're losing money, you don't owe them taxes, so that's super important too. Now, those are the big ones you have to worry about if an employee goes into another state. There's one more, which is sales tax, and sales tax, it used to be strictly based on having employees, or having assets, or doing a lot of sales in the state, but the Supreme Court three years ago ruled that you may even have to pay sales tax, even if you don't have a presence in that state. So sales tax got a lot more complicated three years ago, but just know that if you do have an employee moving into a state, it kind of brings the threshold down. It makes it more likely that you'll have to pay sales tax in that state on sales generated in that state.",

And today I'm talking about changes, in the Employee Retention Tax Credits, that are in the Build Back Better Act. Now, if that is not a tongue twister, I don't know what is. \n\nBut the Biden Administration just signed in a bunch of tax reform and there's some good things and some bad things in there for startups. The good thing is, one of the tax credits, the new Recovery Startup Business Tax Credit, which basically gives up to $50,000 in payroll taxes on a quarterly basis to startups that were formed after February 15th, 2020. So basically, if you were formed after COVID started, you are eligible for a $50,000 tax credit. It's been going on in Q3 already, we've already been doing tons of these, but Q4, it is preserved. You will still be able to get that up to $50,000 tax credit in Q4. \n\nIt's based on, I think it's capped at $5,000 per employee. So you kind of need to have like 10 engineers basically, or 10 people, not just engineers, to be eligible for that. But that is preserved that will go forward in Q4, if you are a relatively new company, and formed after February 15th, you will be in... February 15, 2020, you'll be in good shape and can get that. So talk to your friendly CPA, don't have a CPA, you know where to find them at kruzeconsulting.com, shameless plug there. But, there's some bad news, and, there was another form, like kind of the earliest form of Employee Retention Tax Credit, which was in 2020 and even the first half of 2021. That has been eliminated for Q4. \n\nThose were based on reductions in revenue, and there's different thresholds every quarter, some quarters it was 50%, some quarters it was 25%. Also, if your company shut down because of COVID, you were eligible, you know, that's like truly shut down, not like, \"Hey, we're working from home and deploying code to get up.\" \"We're working remotely\" kind of thing. But unfortunately, that one has been eliminated. So that was a substantial tax credit for a lot of companies that were really hurting. But they probably have been taking advantage of those tax credits for at least a year now. So I think Congress probably said, \"Hey, we can save a little money here by getting rid of this one. But let's preserve the one that benefits startups that were formed after February 15th, 2020, because hey, that was a really tough time to start a company. \n\nWe want to support those businesses start early, and we want to encourage them to hire.\" So I think that's the logic around this, but, the headline is, if you are a new recovery startup business, you're still eligible for that $50,000 tax credit Q4. If you were a company that was really struggling and were dependent on a tax credit because, or we're eligible for tax credit because you had a material revenue decrease or had shut down the offices or things like that, then, that one's not going to be available for you in Q4. \n\nOther interesting stuff in the Build Back Better legislation that I'll cover in some other videos.

      "description": "How long does it take to negotiate a term sheet?\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nThe quick answer is anywhere from an hour to a week. It's actually really, really quick assuming you actually have the term sheet, like it's been issued, it's sitting in your hot little hands. That is very, very important. Do not negotiate hypothetical term sheets. Negotiate the one that is sent to you in a PDF format by the venture capitalist who you've been talking to. Now, of course, the hard part, anything in life, the hard part is getting your first term sheet, but people also know that running a process, if you can get a couple bidders, that's where you usually end up getting a really good deal. \n\nBut if you're one of the people who only gets one bidder, there are tons and tons of startup stories about how a founder could only get one term sheet, and then eight years later, they're a billion dollar IPO startup, so don't feel bad. The most important thing is get one. And if you get one, try to get two, because that's how you can play people off each other a little bit in a friendly way, respectful way, and get better terms. So you want to be patient until you get your first term sheet. Sometimes you'll hear people, they'll throw out these crazy schedules of like, you got to get me a term sheet by X, Y, and Z date. And if you don't have a term sheet already or have a very good feeling you're going to get one, you could actually be shooting yourself in the foot because sometimes that day will come and go and you end up with nothing. \n\nAnd it's like, how do you restart the process? It's actually pretty hard. So my advice is to be pretty conservative, actually, until you get that from first term sheet. Answer all the investors' questions, do whatever it takes, appear at the partner's meetings, do demos, whatever you need to do to get one group over the hump. So after you get the first term sheet, you're in great shape, but here are a couple tips to kind of help you get over that proverbial hump here. The first one is know your valuation and desired dollar ask going in. You're definitely going to be asked about it. Pretty much every meeting you'll be asked about, you know, what are you looking for, what valuation, how much money are you looking for? \n\nAnd there's some people who give founders advice and say, you know, do not throw out a number. That will only be used against you. Let the venture capitalists start, and hopefully they will start at a very high number and that will benefit you. I take a little bit of a different tactic. I'm kind of like a ask for what you want kind of person. So I would certainly have a target valuation and a dollar amount. Oftentimes, those are driven by the target valuation translates to investor's going to buy 20% of your company. So whatever your target valuation is multiplied by 20%, right? But have something, because you just don't want to waste time. And if you get that number, you're going to be happy. The way to drive that number up over time is to get two bids. \n\nSo I would just recommend being very focused, know what you want. This also helps you on the second point, which is go to investors who specialize in the stage and industry you are in. So the worst thing you can do is go meet with a seed stage investor and ask for a series B style term sheet, right? A seed stage investor is going to invest anything from one to five million, not $25 million, right? So make sure you've done the research ahead of time so that you can understand where they'd like to play in the timeline, you know, series seed, series A, series B, et cetera, and what kind of checks they normally write. You can waste a lot of time going to venture capitals who will never be able to give you a term sheet for what you're looking for, so be smart about that. Knowing what you're looking for going in helps you with that because you just don't waste time. It's not a discovery process for you. \n\nNow, if you're having a hard time negotiating or getting to that point where the VC will issue the term sheet, ask them what their ownership targets are. That's a good way of kind of cutting to the chase, because sometimes they may be talking around evaluation or talking around a dollar amount or there's something else going on, and just asking that direct question, most investors want a 20% ownership level. Now, they're willing to come down from that oftentimes through a negotiation, but that's usually what they're going to want.",

So they're shifting into sales mode once they give you that term sheet, and the last thing they want is for you to take that term sheet and walk up and down Sand Hill Road or in New York or wherever you're based and get a better deal using that term sheet as leverage. It's social proof. They're giving you a term sheet. There's a lot of money involved and they want you to consummate the deal. They want you to work with them. \n\nAnd so often, almost always in a VC term sheet, there will be some type of no-shop provision, and basically what this means is the management team of the startup who's negotiating this term sheet is not able to take this term sheet and actively shop it. Furthermore, if they get inbound interests, whether there's acquisition or just another round, another VC fund, they're supposed to disclose that to the investor syndicate they sign the term sheet with. Now, one of the most important things here is that, for it to be effective, you actually have to sign the term sheet. So what you kind of practically see is founders getting a term sheet, and then aggressively, but discreetly, shopping that term sheet for a week or so with other VC firms to try to get everyone up to whatever deal terms they want, or to get the firm they really want to work with to give them a term sheet. That gets into exploding term sheets. \n\nUsually venture capitalists give you like a week or so for a term sheet still to be good. Any shorter than that, it looks a little desperate. Any longer than that, it's just kind of asking for the term sheet to be shopped. So that's in another video, called \"Exploding Term Sheets\". But for our purposes, you usually see like a no-shop period, kind of one to three months. I would highly recommend not agreeing to a long no-shop, because it can actually create some really negative incentives for the VC fund, especially if you're running out of cash. \n\nSo just to kind of play this forward here, say you sign a term sheet, has a long no-shop, has a three-month no-shop. That's a long time. And the VC firm knows you're kind of getting low on cash. Well, guess what. They may try to let the no-shop get all the way to the end and exert a ton of pressure on you and try to re-trade the deal because they know you're almost out of cash. And so you can end up with a really kind of negative, they-have-all-the-leverage type of thing. \n\nNow you might say, well, hey, I have a lot of cash. I don't have to worry about that. But still, you don't want a long no-shop, because when you go out and create like an auction to generate term sheets from investors, you're fresh, they know you, they know what's going on, and when you elect to sign a term sheet with another firm, you immediately become kind of like, it's a negative signal to all the other VC firms. You didn't pick them. It's like picking someone else to go to the dance, the prom. Well, are the other guys or girls going to want to go with you if that date ditches you? Probably not. \n\nSo what happens is, if that no-shop runs out and it's a long no-shop, your company can be stale. They might just not want to even re-engage with you. Furthermore, you probably spent a lot of time on this fundraise, and oftentimes what we see is, companies, when they're, the founders can only do so many things, there's only so many hours in the day, and so the performance of the company in the very short-term, when they're negotiating these terms sheets and getting everything done, will suffer a little bit. If you just think about it, you're not calling on customers as much. You're not recruiting new people as much. You're spending a lot of time with the venture capitalists.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today I'm answering the question, \"What do you do if your startup raised capital \"at a huge valuation before the market declined?\" \n\nNow this is a tough situation, but the good news is, you can make it work. You have the capital, and now you just need to execute. So the first thing you're gonna do, is you're gonna make sure you extend your cash runway. That way you don't have to raise money for a really long time. There's a couple ways to do that. \n\nFirst, really scrutinize your expenses. Make sure you're spending money intelligently. Make sure that money's just not flying out the door for nonessential things, and make sure that the people that are working at the company are all A-players and worthy of their salary. And if they're not A-players and worthy of their salary, there are a lot of fantastic people hitting the market. You can actually make some adjustments and hire some new people at the appropriate salary, and it can really strengthen your company. So looking at your expenses, being smart about that, and then upgrading your team at the appropriate salaries can make a huge difference. \n\nThe next thing you're gonna wanna do is look at opportunistic capital sources. One really popular one right now which I recommend is Venture Debt. Venture Debt looks at really promising companies and makes a loan on top of the equity in the company, and so they're usually kind of doing 25 to 40% of the equity round, and you can negotiate a forward commitment so you can draw it down in the future. You don't have to draw down right now. That should extend your runway, it's really nice. \n\nThe third thing you should do is look and see if you can collect cash upfront from your existing customers. A lot of big enterprises, especially, are happy to pay upfront if they get a discount. That is a really great way to extend your runway, lower your burn by incentivizing your sales team and your customers to collect cash upfront. Now the other thing you're gonna need to do is really focus on the milestones that are required to raise your next round. And this is maybe the hardest part because one of the things that happens in a market decline is the milestones get a lot tougher. \n\nThe venture capitalists at the next stage are much more choosy, and are slightly risk adverse, and so really be realistic about what those milestones are. Maybe it's 100 paying customers instead of 20, like it used to be. Or maybe it's $10 million in ARR instead of six or seven that you could've got away with a couple months ago. Or maybe it's a certain number of million of subscribers if you're a consumer rep. Whatever it is, be super realistic, know what that new milestone is, sanity check that with your board and then message that to your team. \n\nIt's super important to keep your team in the loop, so they know if the goalposts have moved. They'll accept the new reality, and they'll help the company achieve that milestone. \n\nSo these are ways that can really help you if you raise money at a really high valuation, and think you might be in a little bit of trouble on your next round. Again, cut costs where appropriate, level up your team with the appropriate salaries, raise venture debt or alternatively, sources of funds like your clients or customers paying in advance, and then make sure you vet your milestones, make sure you're realistic about them, because they've probably changed, and then communicate that to your team. \n\nThat's the survival guide to surviving when you raise money at a really big valuation. You can do this, you can grow into that valuation. Don't give up, just focus on executing.",

      "description": "Stock Option Vesting Cliff\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nToday we're explaining stock option vesting cliffs. And essentially stock options, a lot of startup employees get these. It's one of the reasons people work at startups. They typically trade a higher salary for some equity participation in the company. And so that participation typically comes in the form of stock options or restricted shares known as RSUs. We'll just kinda use them as the same today, stock options. And typically they are vested over a four-year period. Meaning, you know, every year you vest 25% of your initial stake, and so it pays to stay for four years at least at a really great company if the valuation's increasing, and you think there's gonna be an exit opportunity. But the first year is a little bit different than the other years in that, there's typically what's called a cliff, and that's what we're talking about. Meaning you have to clear the full one year timeline before you vest any shares at all. This is designed to make sure you're a good fit for the company. They don't wanna give out a bunch of shares to someone, you know, who ends up leaving in a couple months. \n\nSo typically people use the one-year mark as like, \"Hey! We like you, you're great, and here's your vesting of a full one year of stock options.\" And then after that point, you get to vest on a monthly basis. So essentially after the first year, you start vesting 1/48th of your initial grant every month, until you hit the four year period and you're completely vested. Now, it is possible to do what's called retention grants during that time. So sometimes maybe someone's two or three years into their initial vesting. They're making a huge impact. The company really wants to retain them. They'll do what's called a retention grant or give them another grant of options. The retention grant, it all depends. I mean, if you're a total superstar you might get a bigger package than the first one but usually the first kind of bucket of stock options is your biggest bite of the apple. \n\nNow, does the retention grant have a cliff on it? Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. It's a very negotiable thing in the management team and the board makes that decision. Typically, most of the time we see it not having a cliff meaning you just start vesting, you know 1/ 48th every month of your retention grant. So that's important to look at and it's always great when you do get that retention grant. The final thing we should cover is just like what happens if you're terminated by the company, you know before your, you know before your one-year vesting cliff and you hear these horror stories of someone who was fired or terminated or whatever one, you know, one week or one month before they were going to vest, something that became super valuable. \n\nWell, in that case, the company does have some discretion and can work something out. It's important, the way the option language is worded they're not obligated to that. So they're never gonna say that they're obligated to work something out or be nice to you or, or vest you even though you didn't clear that one year. But it's something you can ask for. You know, if you're leaving on good terms and maybe it just wasn't a fit or there's some other extenuating circumstances like someone in your family's not doing too well or or things like that. It's very fair to ask for either the one-year cliff vest or you know, some ratio of that maybe 10 months, if you're if you're leaving after 10 months. So don't be afraid to ask it's okay to do that. \n\nAnd you know, it is negotiable again the company is not going to feel or let themselves be obligated to it, but they might you know, do your favor and take care of you. So I hope that helps. Remember, the cliff in stock options is typically set at one year. \n\nAnd once you clear that one year cliff you vest a full year of options after that you get to vest monthly. Hope that helps. Thanks!",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today, we're talking about how do startups value stock options? \n\nNow, this is something that's super important to the startup, but it's also super important to employees. That's one of the reasons they're working at a startup is the equity upside. Now there is a mechanism called a 409A valuation, and that is a valuation done by an accredited valuation shop. And what they do is they measured the valuation or the value of those stock options in three ways. \n\nThe most frequent way is what's called a Back Solve Method. And what they're doing is working backwards. Hence the Back Solve Method from the preferred stock valuation. So when an investor puts $10 million in a company at a $40 million valuation and that's 40 million dollars for the preferred valuation, the Back Solve Method looks at that and discounts back for the common stock, which is what's typically issued to employees in stock options and says, You know what, preferred has a liquidation preference and they have a couple other features. So that's more valuable than common. \n\nSo we're going to discount that. And typically, the discount ends up being that the common is about worth about 30 to 40 percent of whatever the preferred price is. So 40 million dollar preferred valuation. You're probably looking at like a 12 to 16 million dollar common stock valuation. \n\nNow, the second way that stock options are valued are on a Cost to Recreate basis, meaning if we just tried to build all the technology again, how much would it cost? Now, there's this is a little bit of a subjective way of doing it, but the founder will typically fill out a very detailed worksheet that says how much all this would have cost to build. And that's the valuation for the stock options. Now, of course, you learn some things along the way and probably you could have built things a little bit cheaper, but it's usually about how much was spent in invested capital to get to where you are. That's a good little rule of thumb. \n\nThe third way is called a Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, which is looking at the projected cash flows of the company in the future. And then you discount it back to the present time. Now, this works great for more mature companies, but isn't very good for startups because startups lose tons of money for a really long time and then they do make a lot of money in the future when they turn cash flow positive. If they do. But it's really hard to project that. It's hard to know with any kind of certainty. And the discount rates bump all over the place. And so DCF's are kind of the... they're included, but they're not really relied on for stock option valuations. \n\nSo those are the three ways the Back Solve Method, the Cost to Recreate and a DCF. And the Back Solve Method is used way more than everything else because that preferred valuation is a really good valuation and it's set by a really sophisticated investor. \n\nSo that's why Back Solve Method is used so much to value employee stock options. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

The banks, again, are usually a little bit more restrictive and use investor abandonment clauses so they can be more aggressive on the interest rate; aggressive being lower. So, a typical bank interest rate will be somewhere around five, five and a half, six percent all in. That's the cash interest you're paying every year on the money you borrow. \n\nNow, funds, they actually let you use the money a little bit more fluidly and so they don't have the MAC or investor abandonment. So, therefore, they need to charge more. So, the average interest rates we're seeing on fund term sheets are somewhere around ten and a half to twelve percent. That's the TriplePoint, WTI, type of deals. All in ten and a half to twelve percent interest rates. \n\nSometimes the upfront interest rate is a little bit low like maybe 8 percent. And then there's a final payment that is paid at the end of the loan which brings the total IRR up to that ten and a half percent range. \n\nSo, again, these are the average interest rates you're going to see on a venture debt term sheet. You're going to see five, five and a half, six percent on banks at ten and a half to twelve percent on the fund term sheets. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nRaising venture debt? Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today we’re talking about the average warrant coverage on a venture debt deal. \n\nA typical venture debt deal can be kind of two flavors. \n\nFirst is the bank, and again banks use investor abandonment, some of the stricter clauses, so they can be more aggressive on warrant coverage. And by aggressive, I mean ask for less work and less ownership in your startup. A typical bank warrant coverage will be somewhere around 1 percent of the deal amount so to a million-dollar loan, 1 percent of that would be ten thousand dollars in a warrant, something around there. \n\nNow, usually, you can also translate this to fully diluted ownership in the startup and that's usually going to be around .1 percent. So, point .15 percent of the startup. So, again, banks are cheaper because they use more restrictive clauses. Nothing wrong with that. They're upfront about it. Just know that’s going in. \n\nThe second type of lender is a fund lender. Now they're letting you use the money a little bit more flexible and in a more flexible manner. And so, they're going to charge more. They don't have the MAC. They don't have the investor abandonment. Typical warrant coverage for fund lender is anywhere from 6 to 10 percent of the deal. \n\nSo, again, in that million-dollar deal scenario, we're talking from 60,000 dollars to 100,000 dollars of warrant coverage or equity in your company. Now, that usually translates to about 25 to 50 basis points of the entire company. Sometimes, when the fund lender is being very aggressive and giving you a lot of money, that number can actually edge up to 1 percent of the company total value or total ownership. \n\nNow again, the great thing about venture debt is it’s less dilutive. So, you're getting a lot more cash and you're giving up less ownership. However, you always need to remember that this money needs to be paid back. Investor equity dollars don't necessarily need to be paid back. Or in a downside scenario aren't going to be paid back. So, the lender is trading off a lot of risk for a lower return. And so, again,\n\n we see on average warrant coverage for a bank is going to be somewhere around 1 percent. And for a fund lender that's going to be six to 10 percent of the deal amount and for the bank that's going to translate to about .1 percent of the company. \n\nAnd for the fund lender, it's going to be a point to .25 percent to .5 percent. Those are averages but that's typically what we see at Kruze Consulting when we're negotiating venture debt deals. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nRaising venture debt? Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're talking about letters of credit from banks and why startups should know about them.  \n\nThe big reason why startups use letters of credit is to give their landlord at their new office space a defacto deposit. It's basically collateral for the landlord. And so, what the startup will do will have their bank issue a letter of credit may be for $100,000 maybe for $200,000. The bank will segregate that cash out of the startup's normal operating account, back the letter of credit with that cash, the startup can't touch it anymore because it's backing that letter of credit, and then the bank hands over the letter of credit to the landlord. \n\nNow, this is preferred because you're not... You don't necessarily want to transfer a hundred, two hundred thousand dollars to your landlord.  and just hope they'll get it back for you.  Having the bank on your side, having it documented in a letter of credit is much safer for the startup, and it's much easier logistically.  \n\nSo that's why startups use a letter of credits. There’re a few other reasons like inventory deposits or things like that, but it's almost always used to secure new office space.  Hope that helps! Thanks!",

Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn Kruze at Consulting. And today we're talking about Fintech companies. And the equity and debt staircase they have to go through. So for Fintech companies. They're raising money to power operations. And write software and run the business. But they also need debt capital to actually loan money out. And so for them, debt and equity become really intertwined. So the first thing a Fintech company should do is raise. You know, two, three, four million dollar seed round or. You know, a bigger round if they can do it. And then as soon as they get that equity. They need to go find a debt partner. That can give them a couple of million dollars of debt that will fund their loans. Now, the debt partners really want to know who the equity investors are. Because debt partners typically only advance about 75 to 80 percent of a loan amount. So, for example. If you're making a bunch of ten thousand dollar loans. The debt capital really only wants to do like seventy-five hundred - eight thousand dollars. of that ten thousand dollar loan. Equity needs to fill the gap. This gives the debt partners a little bit of, you know. There's some skin in the game for the company. They're not just going to do a bunch of bad loans. And it gives them a little bit of cushion. Now, for the equity investors. This is great because they don't have to fund the entire loan amount themselves. They're only funding 20, 25 percent. So the equity and debt work in conjunction. And they're both gonna want to know each other. And they're both going to want to know each other are committed. Now, as the company evolves and they get to their series A,. Where they're raising probably a five to 10. Maybe 15 million dollar series A. That unlocks a lot more debt capital. You can probably do something on a 10 million dollar series A. Around 5 to 8 million dollars of debt capital. Again, they're working in conjunction. And the loan book, the loans that are outstanding are continually growing. Now, once a company gets to series B and series C. They're raising really big dollar amounts of equity. And that unlocks bigger lenders. Lenders that want to do 25 to 50, even sometimes 100 million dollar commitments. To fund the loan book. At this stage, when you're raising that big of equity and that big a debt. Usually have a really good track record of loan performance. Everyone understands what the faults look like. And people have a lot more confidence. So they really get behind the company. Your cost of capital drops dramatically. You're really looking at bank style loans at that point. And then finally, as the company gets to the late stage. They start being able to tap, you know, big SPV's. Special purpose vehicles. Or even Wall Street offerings where they can get the cost of debt.\nWay, way, way down. And this is exciting for equity investors Because now one of the biggest inputs into the company's capital. Structure and cost the debt has gotten a lot cheaper. So the equity investors want to invest money at much bigger valuations and. They can invest a lot more capital. So this is the staircase. You start at seed, you work your way up and every step of the way. You're having your equity and your debt matching each other. Complementing each other until you get to the late stage where you're able to access Wall Street in big debt placements. Hope that helps on the Fintech equity and debt staircase. Thanks.",

      "title": "Extension on Venture Debt Line",
      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nRaising venture debt? Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today we're talking about how to get an extension on your venture debt line. Now, this is a pretty common request from startups. They want to be able to draw the venture debt, but they don't need it quite yet. So they're going to ask the lender whether it's a bank or a fund to extend that drawdown period. Now, if it's a short drawdown, the lenders are usually pretty happy to comply. After all, they want you to draw the money down. That's how they make money on interest. However, it's going to be a lot easier if it's a short term one like one or two months because anything longer than that, they're starting to extend the risk and they don't know what they don't know. So if it's a one or two-month extension, contact your lender ahead of time. Don't do it last minute, in the last couple of weeks before your drawdown period ends. And give them an update on the company how business is going your cash balance, cash burn. Send all your financials. Probably refresh the cap table. And have a really proactive conversation with a lender. They're going to have to take it to their credit committee probably and get it approved. But usually a one or two-month thing, they'll oblige. Now, if you're looking for something like three to six months, or three to nine months, that's a whole different ball game. That's basically treating this deal as a new deal. And oftentimes the lenders will still want to comply because they still want your business, but they're going to underwrite it in the same way they underwrote your first deal. So they're going to do some real in-depth due diligence. They're really going to do a big presentation, their credit committee, and they're going to probably ask for some compensation in the form of maybe a loan extension fee or some more worth in the company. After all, they're taking more risk, thus more risk than they originally thought they're going to take and it's going to be super important that your company is still executing. Now, a lot of times when the company asks for an extension, it means actually the company is executing because they don't really need the money. They're probably hitting plan or overachieving plan. So that makes the lender want to participate and help you out. But if your company is really not doing so well, and you're asking for a couple more months or six months, be prepared for the lender to say no. That's why it's super important for you to get out in front of this. Have this conversation at least two months before the extension, before the original line runs out. That way, you and the lender have plenty of time to work it out. To give them the update. And if the lender says no on a larger extension, then you can go get another deal put in place or go to your investors and ask for more money. I hope that helps with how to get an extension on your venture debt line. Thanks.",

Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today we're talking about what is a standstill or cooling off period in venture debt? \n\nNow, this is the legal term but actually it can have a really huge benefit for a startup. \n\nA cooling off period basically refers to the lender not aggressively foreclosing on the company if they're in default and where this really comes into play it is if the company has given the lender a lien on the intellectual property and all the other assets. \n\nWhen that lender has a lien on all assets including actual property they can foreclose very quickly in 10 to 15 days because they don't have to notify the other creditors who benefit from the sale. If the lender doesn't have all the assets like a lien on IP they'll have to notify all the other creditors like the water person or Kruze Consulting or whoever else the company owes money to. That usually takes 60 and 90 days for foreclosure. So, the cooling off period becomes very important. \n\nIf the lender has all the assets Lien on IP with the cooling off period says is something to the effect that the lender will not foreclose and sell the company within something like 90 days or 120 days that's very negotiable as long as the management team is involved and the board is involved and they're helping to sell the company. What the lender really cares about is if the company actually gets sold and the lender knows that if it's sold without management team cooperation and board cooperation then they're going to get ten cents on the dollar. They are going to have a very good recovery. So, what the lender is doing in agreeing to a cooling off here is saying hey as long as you're playing ball and helping us sell the company helping us get our money back we're fine not aggressively foreclosing for 90 or 120 days. So, this is a very important term. If you're giving your lien on IP away to the lender because what you're basically doing is ensuring as long as you're engaged as the management team and board you're not going to get taken advantage of and have a really quick foreclosure. \n\nNow, of course, say you agree in this term in management and just quits and will not help the lender sell the company. Then, of course, the lender is going to move quickly and this term will be thrown out the window. \n\nBut I do recommend putting this cooling off period language in a term sheet that you're giving all the assets of the company with. Hope that helps. This is we've been talking about cooling off periods or standstills in venture debt. Thanks.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nRaising venture debt? Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey It's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today I'm answering the question, what are the prevailing interest rates, and warrant coverage in venture debt? \n\nAnd in venture debt you have two types of lenders: banks and then the fund lenders. So let's go through the banks first. Banks tend to be a lot cheaper. So right now it's somewhere between 5 to 7% interest rates. \n\nAnd then the warrant coverage is also a lot cheaper. Usually it's like 1% of the deal amount. Maybe 2% of the deal amount. Usually that kind of equals like .25% of the company's total ownership. \n\nSo banks are much cheaper than fund lenders. Those are the prevailing rates but also remember, banks typically use Investor Abandonment clauses, MAC clauses, other covenants that kinda restrict you a little bit, that's how they can get away with having lower interest rates and lower warrant coverage. \n\nNow fund lenders, they're more flexible. They really let you use the money and typically do bigger deals, but they're more expensive, so fund lenders what I'm seeing these days, is anywhere from 11 to 13% interest rates, that's on the cash side. \n\nThen the warrant coverage is anywhere from 8 to 12% of the deal amount. So if you're doing a million dollar deal, and the warrant coverage is 12%, which is on the high side. But I'm seeing that quite a bit, then that will be a hundred and twenty thousand dollars of warrants in the company, above and beyond what the interest rate cash payments are. \n\nSo hope that helps. Again, banks somewhere around 5 to 7% interest rates, 1 to 2% warrant coverage. Funds, anywhere from like 11 to 13% interest rates, and warrant coverage from 8 to 12% of the deal amount. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nRaising venture debt? Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nThe first mistake is the old, ''Hey, give me as.'' I'll start over. Hey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today we're covering the topic. Six mistakes startups make when raising venture debt. And the first mistake is the old, ''Hey, give me as much debt as possible.'' When a founder tells the lender that the alarm bells go off in the lender's head. That means the founder is not really that concerned with the lender. They're trying to make this a binary outcome. They're trying to completely maximize the terms on their side and not worrying about paying the debt back. \n\nNow the second mistake companies make is they fail to check the background and reputation of a lender. They fall in love with the term sheet and they're not really thinking about the long term, but this lender is gonna be a part of your capital structure. In fact, they're the senior part of your capital structure. You really need to be able to work with them. And what I've found is new entrants into the market typically try to get into the market by giving really cheap term sheets, but they don't have the stomach and the wherewithal to ride out bumps in the road. So be really careful. I always recommend that startups work with the folks who've been in the market for a very long time because they have a massive incentive to protect their reputation. \n\nNow, the next one is optimizing for cost instead of flexibility. It's really easy to pick the cheapest term sheet, but sometimes the cheapest term sheet is not gonna match what you need to get done in your company. So for example, banks are really great at giving inexpensive term sheets because they're basically lending out their deposit base and there's no cost for that deposit base in this interest rate environment. We all know we barely get anything in our checking account for interest, right? But banks are federally regulated. And so they have to use covenants like material adverse change clauses or investor abandonment clauses to protect them and bring you back to the table if you're not executing, but that's not always the greatest thing for an entrepreneur. \n\nNow, the next one is negotiating too short of an interest-only in amortization period. Sometimes people say that's the term of the debt, but the whole reason you're doing venture debt is to extend your runway. That extra three to six months. If you don't have a long enough interest-only period, you should shoot for six to 12 months and you don't have a long enough term you should shoot for 30 to 36 months and then add those two together. Then you are gonna be paying the debt back before you can actually use it. And it ends up not providing very much runway extension. Now lenders will often structure deals to be very conservative like that because they wanna get off risk as fast as possible. So your goal should be to extend the runway for as long as possible and negotiate the longest interest-only period and the longest amortization period possible. \n\nNow another mistake founders make is they treat the venture debt as a bridge loan. Bridge loans are for equity investors. They are coming in and supporting the company in a tough time. It's kind of like a Hail Mary pass sometimes. Going to your venture lender and trying to get a Hail Mary slash bridge loan is not a good thing to do. First of all, that's not the business they're in and they're also not charging enough for those kinds of deals. And so the risk-reward doesn't match up and so they will be forced to use some of their covenants like material adverse change, investor abandonment, or funding max, and really limit the company's use of that money. It is not a solution for tough situations in bridge rounds. When things are going great and you just need a little bit of runway extension, that's when venture debt really shines. \n\nNow, the final thing that people make mistakes on is they do not stay in touch with the venture lenders and don't give them regular updates. And so venture lenders are fiduciaries just like everyone else in the ecosystem. They have people or funds that give them money or depositors who give them money and they need to keep them up to date. They need to know what's going on with the deal. If you are struggling do not go silent. If you struggle, that's when good clear communication can really help you because the lender will be in the loop and they can actually really help you with restructures or interest-only periods. It's a huge benefit sometimes and trust me, they are very less likely to do restructures or interest-only periods when you're in a tough spot if you have not been keeping in touch with them.",

So when a lender gives your company money, they're going to take a lean on all the assets of the company, meaning cash, you know, accounts receivable, the office equipment, whatever it is. And there's one asset that's super valuable in startups because they're building intellectual property and it's their intellectual property. And so lenders typically want to get a lien on that which means they get the proceeds when intellectual property is liquidated in a downside scenario. \n\nIf the company doesn't make it, company goes bust, at least they can sell the assets, you know, get the cash, sell their furniture, and sell the intellectual property and get paid back, at least partially paid back. But startups and startup management teams boards, venture capitalists, try not to give away the lien on IP if possible and so another term is often introduced and that is the negative pledge on intellectual property or IP for short. And what that means is the borrower is prohibited from pledging their intellectual property to another lender. \n\nSo the nightmare scenario for the first lender is they give you a loan. There's no intellectual property pledged and some other really crafty lender comes in later and just does a loan against the intellectual property and they would get the proceeds if the company went down and sold intellectual property. So the first lender wants to prohibit that and so they invoke or require the negative pledge on intellectual property in their loan. That keeps any lenders from getting in there and getting weird. \n\nBut they don't get all the proceeds from the sale of intellectual property. When there's no direct lien on it, the negative pledge doesn't count as an actual lien. When there's no lien on it, then the proceeds from intellectual property sale are split amongst all the creditors, like the general creditor bucket. So that's like the water person and the lawyer, and the gardener and the lender and even like your friendly, you know, lawyer accountants, right? We all would participate in those proceeds. \n\nAnd so, it's not like a huge deal because you know, those creditors are only going to get a portion of it. There's some loss proceeds, but not having a lien, like a pure lean on intellectual property affects the lender in a different way, which is, they can't foreclose on the company quite as fast. Meaning, I'm a little rusty on how many days exactly. This is bankruptcy law, foreclosure law. But I typically, when you have the lien on all the assets, including intellectual property, there's no other creditors you need to worry about and so you can foreclose. \n\nI believe it's either 15 or 30 days. It's very fast. If there's other creditors that will benefit from the sale of some of the assets, like in the negative pledge situation, then it takes more like 90 days because you have to notify all the other creditors and actually run through a process. So that's kind of the secret reason that lenders like to have the lien on IP. It basically allows them to foreclose faster. Now what does this mean? \n\nPractically speaking, even if you are able to get the lender to agree to a negative pledge on IP, if your company's not doing well and it's struggling and probably not going to be able to raise more money and probably will get liquidated, what you'll probably do, maybe three to six months before you're out of cash is go to the lender and say like, hey, I prefer not to make, you know, full amortizing payments or can you restructure the deal a little bit to give me a little more breathing room and a little bit more time to try to sell the company. In exchange for that restructure, I'm willing to actually give you the lien on intellectual property.",

      "description": "Can you have two venture debt loans?\n\nRaising venture debt? Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question, can you have two venture debt loans? \n\nAnd, the answer is actually yes, it's possible. However, at early stage companies, they're typically only gonna have kinda one loan, because there's still not a ton of traction, there's still not a ton of enterprise value, there's probably not a ton of equity in the company. And so lenders are gonna be pretty careful, they only really wanna be the senior secured lender. But, as a company achieves enterprise value, it starts getting much bigger, more powerful, then lenders will start taking more risk. \n\nAnd you'll typically see if there's two venture debt loans in a company, you'll typically see a senior bank loan, because bank's loans are very very cheap, very inexpensive, maybe 4 to 6% interest rates. So it's smart for companies to leverage that cheap bank capital. But they'll typically want a little bit more debt, they wanna extend their runway as much as possible, and have that optionality. So sometimes they will bring in a subordinate lender, which is typically like a fund or a BDC, someone who's set up to be able to take a lot more risk, they'll be more expensive. Remember banks are federally regulated, so they can't take a ton of risk, like they cannot afford to lose money, otherwise the regulators start coming in, and investigating them, and really kinda clamp down on them. \n\nSo you'll see the bank thing senior, but cheap, and then the funds or BDCs, business development corporations, will do much bigger dollar amounts, and be much more subordinate. But the average cost of capital when you factor in the bank and the fund, is much more attractive than just taking all fund money, and so typically companies will do this. It's actually really great to do, usually it's like $10 or $15 million of ARR, that's a great time to take, two venture debt deals essentially. Now, there's a couple things you need to worry about. \n\nFirst of all, an intercreditor agreement needs to be worked out between the bank, and the fund lender. And, typically most of the funds and banks, have usually worked together. Venture debt's kind of a small place, and so everyone usually has a relationship, if they've been doing it for a while. And they'll typically have kind of a standard intercreditor agreement, but, there are things like negative covenants, that really get negotiated. For example, like who gets to take money out first, if there's a default, or things like maybe financial covenants. Like if a company has to have a certain amount of EBITDA, or revenue growth, or net income, they can only lose a certain amount of money. If those negative covenants get triggered, then the company goes into default, and the two lenders get to fight over who gets the proceeds. \n\nAnd again, typically the senior lender gets the proceeds, and gets kinda made whole first. And so that intercreditor agreement, is really, really important. Typically the senior lender, the bank, will make that subordinate lender sign what's called a subordination agreement, saying yeah like in paper, with a signature saying, \"Hey, the bank gets their money out first. \" So that's really really important. Remember that, also there's typically a cross-default between the two lenders, so say you somehow trip a covenant with the fund lender, maybe you're sued for a ton of money, or again, you violate like your net income, or revenue growth covenants. That cross-default with the subordinate lender, will mean that you are also in default with the bank, or the senior lender. \n\nAnd so you just wanna be really careful. Again, this is why I recommend early stage startups, like series A, series B, they should really only be doing like one venture debt deal. They should have one senior secured lender, but again, as you get to series C, series D, and the company is passing $10 or $15 million of ARR, that's when you can start to look to layer on additional levels of capital, you'll get an average cost capital that's really really attractive. \n\nAnd again, the more debt you raise within reason, without being too aggressive, and potentially bankrupting yourself, means you have a much cheaper cost of capital, and you can hold on to your equity. I hope that helps, I know it's kind of a complex topic, but really when you get to a more, a later stage, it's not so difficult. And, there are a ton of great venture debt lawyers out there, who specialize in this. We at Kruze Consulting know a bunch who can direct you. \n\nAnd then of course, we understand the interplay of all this stuff, and can help you negotiate the deal if you're interested. Thanks!",

      "description": "In this video, you'll learn about the fed raising interest rates and what it means for startup fundraising.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:11 Fed raising interest rates\n01:02 What happened in November, 2021\n02:13 Imagine you're a money manager\n03:38 Venture capitalists\n06:14 Series B round\n06:35 Conclusion\n\n*******************************\nAdditional Resources\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM8CIroeixE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVEmdBdnaH8\n\n*******************************\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections?

And so, you know, venture capital often tracks what's happening in the NASDAQ and some of the other indexes, but usually like a 3 to 6 month lag. And so it's helpful to think like, \"What's happening in stock market? How is that going to affect venture financing, especially if my company needs to raise money?\" Now, the NASDAQ is down about 35% at the time we're recording, mid-June 2022, from the November peak, but the Bessemer cloud index which tracks SaaS companies, which is a better barometer of a lot of startups, is actually down like 60, 65%, so a huge amount. \n\nNow what happened in November, 2021? Well, the market started seeing some pretty intense signs of inflation, and stock market investors are really smart and they worry about inflation all the time. And so what happened is, the investors started selling stocks because they thought, \"You know what? This inflation is going to make the Federal Reserve have to start raising interest rates, and pretty aggressively.\" And so it's this really negative feedback cycle. Investors start selling. The stock market starts coming down. The Fed has to react to inflation and so they start raising interest rates, and so it kind of like, compounds. \n\nNow it's worth mentioning, when rates are going down and there's no inflation, the same compounding benefits the stock market. Like, that's kind of what we experience when the COVID rally happened. Like, interest rates went way down. There wasn't really inflation at all. And so the stock market really, really popped up into those 2021 highs, right? So now, the market's retrenching because inflation has reared its ugly head. Now what does high interest rates mean for stocks? Well, it actually makes the competition for an investment dollar, much more intense. \n\nNow imagine you're a money manager, and all of a sudden bonds are yielding 5% and it's... Bonds are safe. These are big publicly traded bonds and you don't have to do anything. You just have to own the bond and you get paid, right? Or you put your money in a CD and own a couple, and generate a couple interest percentages, right? So all of a sudden, the money that goes into risky stocks, and especially risky private stock, like venture capital backed startups, has more competition for the investment dollar. \n\nAnother way to think about this, is most tech companies and biotechs are not going to generate profits and cash flow and dividends for a very long time, like 5 to 10 years out. And so when interest rates go up, those cash flows that one will get someday, if things go well, are discounted back to the present value of today by a much higher interest rate. And so when you increase the denominator, the interest rate or the rate of return that you're going to discount those cash flows back on, all of a sudden, those cash flows are worth way less, right? A dollar today is worth more than a dollar 10 years ago, especially when interest rates are really high. And so what we've seen is, the market has reevaluated what valuations, tech stocks and private venture capital backed startups should be trading at. \n\nNow, venture capitalists, they don't, they can't react quite as fast as the stock market. You know? The hedge fund people who are just lookin' at the numbers all day long, because venture capitalists are like, they have term sheets out, and they're in the middle of documentation and closing a deal. So it takes them a little while. This is that 3 to 6 month lag that I was talking about. And so, eventually, the VCs say, \"Whoa, wait a second.",

      "title": "How to categorize Customer Success expenses on the P&L",
      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today we're answering the question, how should a bookkeeper categorize customer success expenses in the profit and loss statement? \n\nAnd this is a really important question and we get this a fair amount actually because everybody loves a high gross margin company. Entrepreneurs love it. The venture capitalists love it. Public investors love it. Everyone wants to have a high gross margin company, but when you start loading a lot of expenses into cost of goods sold that by nature reduces your gross margin. The equation for gross margin is revenue minus cost of goods sold equals gross margin. \n\nSo, everyone should be very careful about loading expenses into cost of goods sold. Now, of course, you wanna do it on a GAAP basis, and that's how we do things at Kruze and that's why this guidance is so helpful. So, companies look at customer success in two different ways. Some companies treat that as purely a support organization. Others treat it as a sales organization, they're in charge of upgrading or upselling clients and that's how they pay for those people to work at the company. \n\nSo, if your company treats it as purely support, and there are no commissions, there are no revenue targets, then that should be in cost of goods sold. Put those support costs in cost of goods sold because it's part of the cost for delivering your service. Now, if your Customer Success Organization has milestones and commissions and revenue targets, then that is definitely a sales and marketing expense. It should go into sales and marketing in the operating expenses category. \n\nSo it's not gonna impact your gross margin. Now, there's something really important here to point out, which is in early-stage companies, oftentimes the people who are doing support also have like three other jobs. This is the beauty of working at an early stage company. You get a lot of variety. So we see a lot of times where the head of operations is answering questions or the software development team is actually answering support questions. Or maybe there's one support person, but they're doing something completely different half of their time. \n\nSo, in those cases, you really wanna be smart and you really wanna allocate only the portion of the time equivalent to the portion of the salary for that person or those people into COGS. So again, if someone's doing half their time in operations and half their time in customer support, allocate half of their salary into customer support in COGS, you do not wanna fully burden the COGS with people salaries who are doing other things. The danger in that is it could make your gross margin look really low or even negative. \n\nSometimes we have companies coming from other accounting firms that sell a SAAS product that should be very high margin. And we look into the cost of goods sold, and we see that they've got tons of salaries and stuff that's not applicable loaded in cost of goods sold, which again, depresses the gross margin. And this is a big deal for investors. When they're looking at your profit and loss statement and thinking about the potential of the company, they are absolutely not going to invest in a company with a negative gross margin. That's the old thing where you're selling $100 bills for $90. You cannot scale that business. You can't make up in volume. It's a bad business. People are not gonna wanna invest in it. \n\nSo that's why we take such care and we really focus on what needs to go in the cost of goods sold and customer success is really one of those big ingredients. So, be careful, be smart, make sure you do it on a GAAP accounting basis, fully load the cost of goods sold where appropriate, but also be careful because if people are revenue producing and have commission structures, they should be going into sales and marketing in the operating expense category. I hope this helps. Thanks so much. Bye. Cool.",

      "description": "How do I account for a convertible note investment?\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today I'm going over how to account for a convertible note investment. \n\nConvertible notes are one of the most popular investing instruments for startups. It's preferred equity, common equity, SAFE notes, and converts, and, you know, SAFE notes are relatively new. Convertible debt was really the angel investment instrument of choice for many, many years, and still has, we still see a lot of that activity. Now, just remember, convertible notes are debt, so they do need to be paid back eventually. \n\nMost convertible notes have, something like a 12 to 24 month timeframe, where they're basically outstanding until then. And oftentimes, investors will just sign an extension, or restructure the convertible notes, because they kind of know, that startup funding can ebb and flow, and sometimes it takes longer to raise a round. So, there's usually some flexibility with that, but there is a payment date, usually with convertible debt. That is one reason why convertible debt needs to be booked on the liability side of the balance sheet, so it's not equity, it is a liability. Depending on how long until the debt needs to be paid back, it'll be short-term or long-term. So, short-term is anything below 12 months. When a new convertible note is put in place, it's usually like, kind of, usually really it's 18 to 24 months. \n\nSo, it's usually going to be long-term debt, but of course, as that pay off date gets closer and you cross that 12 month barrier, you're probably going to book it as short term liability. Now, in terms of the accounting treatment, the deposit from the investors for the note, is going to increase your cash and increase your liability, so, a debit cash, credit the short term and long term liability. \n\nNow, eventually, when another round of capital comes in, the convertible debt's kind of like a placeholder, it's the angels or seed stage firms getting into the company, but everyone waiting for a bigger, later stage round to happen, at which point they'll convert at a price determined by the cap, that's negotiated in the note. So, you know, a seed stage company takes a million dollars in convertible notes, and then a year later, it closes a $10 million series A round. \n\nWell, that convertible note is going to be wiped off the balance sheet and converted into preferred equity. Sometimes there's a mix of preferred and common equity, but it's going to shift from the liability part of the balance sheet, all of the way to the equity balance sheet. So, convertible notes are our investments made with the intention that it will become equity eventually, but it's debt at the moment the investment is made. \n\nAnd again, it's all going to convert, once a bigger, later round happens. Now, if the company doesn't make it, and maybe the assets are sold for pennies on the dollar, the convertible note holders can get some, can get a little bit of money back. If the company is sold for a big win, oftentimes what happens, is the convertible notes are just treated as, they convert at the cap. And so, they get to participate in the upside of the exit. \n\nSo, I hope that helps. Convertible notes are still a very important instrument in the startup ecosystem.

      "description": "Where Should Startups Put Their Cash?\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nThe first is yield, the second is risk and the third is access. And so let's kind of go through that. Yield is a little bit self-explanatory. You kind of just want to get the best interest rate or best return you possibly can without ignoring the other two criteria. So, we all know that risk and return kind of go hand in hand. So you don't want to put your money as a startup into something risky, like the stock market or high yield bonds, or back in the day, people thought auction rate securities were not risky, but they turned out to be super risky and a lot of that money got evaporated in the 2008 crash. So you want to have a yield that's like, you definitely want to get some yield on this. \n\nEspecially like the startups are raising like 20 to 40 million bucks. That's a lot of money if you're able to get like 50 basis points or 1% on it, you're talking like real money, like that's enough to fund a couple of hires throughout the year. But you have to be careful. You do not want to take too much risk, which is our second criteria here because the people who are investing in your company, the venture capitalists, the angel investors, even the people that work there, they're not doing, they're not, working with your company because they want you to be a hedge fund or they want you to like reinvent the wheel on cash management. They want you to put that money to work building the business instead of trying to do crazy financial engineering. So they want you to hire people. They want you to build a great product. They want you to sell it. That's how they're going to make their money investing in you. \n\nAnd so taking risks in the bond market or doing something other crazy with your cash is not acceptable to them. It's a very good way of getting fired and getting kicked out of your own startup. I mentioned the auction rate security stuff back, you know, in 2008, people had been kind of sold or tricked into putting their money in these illiquid bond markets and I know at Lighthouse we had a company that has $30 million frozen and the whole management team got fired. And so you just want to be very, very careful. You started this whole startup journey to build something great, to change the world, not to be a financial engineer. \n\nSo watch out for risk. Access is the third most important criteria, which is basically being able to get at that money in a very easy way. And so like a checking account, which usually pays no interest is always going to be available to you. Savings account is kind of the next up the rung of bank account, checking account, savings account, but savings accounts do usually pay a very, very modest interest rate right now. So like I'm recording this in the Summer of 2021. So interest rates are very, very low. So you might get like a 0.1% interest, like 10 basis points on your savings account. Like really not, it's not going to move the needle for you that much unless you've got 20 to 40 million bucks in that savings account, but very easy access, can access that day, can transfer that money into the operating accounts, typically checking account, same day immediately. \n\nSo access on the savings account is very good. It's also usually very convenient because you can, your bank is going to have, of course they're going to have savings accounts, right? So you'll typically set up an operating account, which is checking and then having savings accounts. So super easy, very high access, but relatively low yield. The next step in this would be, that I recommend, especially if you have a lot of cash, is putting it into like a money market type of it's, it's technically a fund, but money markets have really kind of blurred to be very easy access as well. \n\nAnd we typically see all the banks we work with, SVB, Bridge Bank, Comerica, Mercury has a treasury management product now. I think Rho has something. All those firms offer something along those lines, like something essentially more sophisticated than a savings account, which will get you a higher interest rate. Not a huge interest rate, but it'll help. Maybe you're looking at 25 basis points up to maybe 40. Like I know JP Morgan has a really nice, fairly sophisticated money market fund that's got like a trillion dollars in assets. Yes, you heard that right, trillion. And there's that much cash floating around in the economy right now.",

Kruze’s clients have raised over $10 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today I'm answering the question \"How much cash should a startup keep in its operating bank account?\" \n\nSo to begin, it's helpful to know that startups typically have usually two bank accounts. One is like the normal checking account and the other is a savings/money market; some type of cash yielding vehicle account. And the bulk of the company's cash is kept in that money market/savings account, but a portion of it is kept in the operating account. And the operating account is used to pay the bills and the credit card and run payroll. It's kind of like the working capital of the company. And so a very frequent question I get from a cash management perspective is how much cash to keep in the operating account versus how much in the savings/money market account. \n\nAnd I tend to think about this in terms of months of burn rate or months of operating expense. So say you're... I'm just going to take a very round number, $500,000. You're spending $500,000 a month as a startup. That's a pretty healthy operating expense. So maybe some of the seed stage companies are spending more like $200,000 or something like that. Well so, I recommend keeping two to three months of cash in the operating account. So if you're spending 500K, then keep a million bucks to 1.5 million bucks in that operating account. Now this is really a personal preference thing. I meet a lot of companies that want to keep as much cash as possible in those interest-bearing accounts, the money market savings. \n\nAnd so they'll keep one month of cash in the operating account. Now that means they have to transfer money in more often and they run the risk of forgetting to do the transfer and missing payroll, or not paying their credit card off in time or whatever it is. But they're on the ball and they want to maximize the interest they earn in that money market savings account, so that's what they do. We have other clients that are super focused on building a product or running the business and they just don't want to forget. \n\nAnd so they'll keep more like four months of cash in their operating account. Again, very much a personal preference, but those companies that are more conservative and leaving a little bit of interest on the table, just know they're not going to miss a payroll on accident or anything like that. So it's really personal preference. Again, I'm more of like a two to three months of operating burn or expenses in the bank account, but do what feels right for you. \n\nBut remember, interest rates are still pretty low on the yield basis, meaning banks aren't paying a lot of interest for money in those accounts, or money market funds aren't paying a lot of interest, But interest rates are starting to go up, so this is one of those things you may tweak just a little bit. Also super helpful if you have a cash management policy that's approved by the board that kind of irons this stuff out and expresses it. I find that's a really helpful thing for startups to do. Just put it on a piece of paper, get the board to ratify it, and that way you have a policy. But again, no extremely right answer.",

      "description": "Benefits of Startups Offering a 401k\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today, I'm just kind of spelling out the benefits of a 401k for a startup's employees. \n\nSo this is a good program to put into place if you're a startup, especially is like, kind of farther along and you don't even really need to do matching, like matching is something that usually like more mature companies or cashflow positive companies will do. Like, for example, Kruze Consulting, we match employee 401k contributions, right? But for a startup, if you're venture funded, you don't really need to do that, but it's a good idea to get something in place. \n\nLike it's a nice perk for the employees and kind of, here's why, the big thing is, when you put money into a 401k, you don't have to pay taxes on it. Like capital gains, income taxes, anything like that while the money's in the 401k. And so this means that you have a bigger balance, like more money to actually grow over time. And if you start a 401k, if like, say you're an early startup employee, say you graduate college and you're working at like age 22. \n\nWell, by the time you retire, that's going to have like 30 or 40 years in the 401k to work and compounding every month on a tax-free basis will actually make a huge difference in the size of your 401k when you go to retire. Now, of course, as you start pulling money out of that 401k later, it is taxable. But again, you've gotten the benefit of compounding on the bigger base the whole time. Another nice benefit of 401k is your near term taxes are lower, any dollar you put into a 401k is put in on a pre-tax basis, meaning the government didn't tax those dollars. And so, say you make, let's make the math work very easily. You make a hundred thousand dollars, you put $15,000 into your 401k. Well, your addressable income that can be taxed is now $85,000. \n\nIt's gone down by the $15,000 that you contributed to 401k, it's pre-tax money. Again, this is, that money is sheltered from taxes along the way and you paid less taxes today, which is a really nice thing. So I hope, if you're watching this and you're running a startup, you'll consider doing a 401k. We have a bunch of 401k analysis on the kruzeconsulting.com website, but you know, there's a bunch of providers. It's not going to matter a huge amount of who you work with. \n\nWork with someone who has a nice integration with your payroll system, has nice reporting for your friendly CPA firm, Kruze Consulting, but getting it in place will actually give a really nice benefit to the employees of the startup. And it doesn't really cost much. \n\nIt's very, very cheap for the startup to pay. Hope that will helps and if you have any other questions on 401ks, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com, thank you.",

Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about one of my favorite new tools, Frame.ai. \n\nAnd what Frame does is it plugs into your support infrastructure,\nfor us it's Zendesk, and indexes all the tickets, all the conversations that are happening. \n\nAnd then its AI goes through and rates conversations, and it's able to rate the risky ones, where maybe the tone's getting elevated, or certain words are getting used. And it's also able to surface all your big wins. So, we love the wins because we can highlight our team in front of the whole company, saying what a great job they did. So that's really rewarding. \n\nAnd on the risk side, we can jump in there and make sure the problem gets solved, and make sure the clients getting the service that they need and that we should be doing. So, we really love the tool. Now, the tool also has a feedback mechanism where you can kinda train it. \n\nSo sometimes there are some false positives, like they may think there's an elevated conversation but it's really not. Someone's using slang or talking about someone else that they're working with, you know, another service provider. So you can actually train the Frame system to get smart and learn from itself. Now, the thing about their pricing is, they've got an enterprise-level and they've also got the SME levels. \n\nSo, Enterprise is what you'd expect. It's a little more expensive but those companies are huge and have huge support teams, so they get a ton of value on it. And for SMBs like us, the price point is really nice, it's really affordable and it's really easy to onboard. \n\nSo, I highly recommend you check out Frame.ai, it really makes your support infrastructure a lot smarter and helps the business people in the organization react, triage when necessary, but also recognize the people who are doing a really great job. I hope that helps. Thanks. Cool, okay.",

      "title": "What should I do if my 409A valuation is too high?",
      "description": "What should I do if my 409A valuation is too high?\n\nIf you’re a startup issuing equity compensation (Options/NQSO/ISO), you’ll need a 409A for startup purposes. Get started now at https://kruzeconsulting.com/409a_valuation/\n\n- There is a very systemic problem in the startup world with valuations coming in too high, and the reason for that is 409A providers are heavily scrutinized by two groups. The valuation accreditation entities that really audit, and look at their stuff, and make sure they're doing everything in compliance, and then the IRS. The IRS really wants these valuations to be fair, AKA, not too low because if they're too low, a bigger percentage of the taxes come as capital gains taxes, which have a lower tax rate, so the IRS wants these to be accurate. \n\nIn the old days, boards just used to get together and just make up a price, and then the IRS said, hey, you got to start doing a 409A valuation for this, so that's where this all came from. Now, it's really frustrating because this pressure from the IRS and accreditation entities ends up pushing the valuation people to be more conservative, and more conservative in valuations means a higher valuation. It means that your company, on paper, even though you probably haven't accomplished a ton yet because you're still a startup, is going to have a much, much higher valuation, and so, that stinks for all the employees out there who have to exercise their stock at much higher valuations, so it's important to be able to talk to your 409A provider, and really work with them, and point out some of the things that makes your startup unique, and your situation not just something like a math equation on paper. \n\n- One of the first things you can do is point out those valuation people, say hey, I know I just closed a round. I know you're using the back solve method, which basically means you're working off of my preferred valuation, but that's a preferred evaluation. The VCs are taking a huge bet on me. They have a huge portfolio of companies, and I'm sure they want us to be successful, but it's not guaranteed, and more important, the VCs have liquidation preference and a bunch of other rights that make their shares way more valuable than my common, so just have that conversation, remind them. \n\n- The second thing you want to do is you want to make sure you give appropriately conservative financials to the valuation folks. One mistake I see all the time is that founders will provide the same financials that they use to woo their venture capitalist and everybody, including the venture capitalists know that those projections are pie in the sky, and are very unlikely to be hit. Not many companies ever hit their projections, and so, you want to give the inside case, the conservative case to the valuation people. If you give financials that say you're going to be doing $100,000,000 in revenue in three years, then you're going to get a really high valuation. Use the conservative. If you can do 10 in three years or 15 in three years, that's more appropriate, and that will be really good. \n\n- The third thing you want to do is make sure you pick your comparable companies intelligently. So if you're picking Microsoft and Google, and you're a hardware company, or don't have a monopoly-like those companies do, your margin structure is going to be way worse than them, and you're going to trade at much lower valuations. Also, if you're comparing your company to the new hot IPO that just went public a couple of months ago, it's trading at 100 times revenue, that's going to hurt your valuation. That's going to make your valuation so much higher than it really should be, so pick your comparable companies appropriately. Be conservative. Throw in some older stage companies that are more mature that aren't going to trade at crazy valuations, assuming they are a good comp, and just walk the valuation provider through that. It's really important. You want to end up somewhere in the 25 to 35% ratio of common to preferred, meaning if preferred is $1, you want common to be somewhere around 25 cents, 30 cents. \n\n- As you're getting to 35 cents on a ratio basis, you're getting up there, and again, it's not really the valuation people's faults. They've kind of built this process that's as robotic as it possibly can so that they can scale, and they're trying two appease to different groups. They're trying to appease the IRS / accreditation firms, and then are also trying to appease your startup, but we all know that the IRS comes first, and so, they're going to be very conservative, so you just need to have that conversation and make sure you're looking out for your employees, so that they don't have to pay a valuation on their common stock, on their options. That's just way too high.",

      "description": "Cost to Recreate 409A Explained\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm explaining the cost to recreate method for 409A valuations. And let's start with 409A valuations first. \n\nA few years ago, the IRS decreed that all stock options for employees need to have an actual fair valuation. They were worried that companies were issuing stock options at too low valuation which meant lower tax proceeds for the IRS. So they instituted the 409A valuation requirement. So that's why there's all this hubbub over actually getting a real valuation. \n\nNow, a lot of valuation providers will use the back-solve method to do a valuation. Which basically means they work backwards from your preferred valuation and apply a bunch of discounts because preferred stock has liquidation preferences and redemption rights and dividend provisions, and you can control the big decisions with a share class vote. So there's a lot of value in preferred stock versus common stock. And so the common stock trades at a significant discount. \n\nNow, if your company hasn't done, done a round with the valuation, either ever, or in a very long time, or maybe you've done a convertible note or safe note with no implied valuation in the form of a cap, then what do you do? You can't use the back-solve method. And so that's when the cost to recreate comes in. The cost to recreate basically says like how much would this company have to spend to rebuild or recreate all the technology that they have built to date? \n\nAnd so it's actually kind of the closest you can get to a perfect valuation here. And so to build the cost to recreate, you're basically gonna go through all your expenses over time and calculate them. You're kinda like essentially capturing the income statement. And so all the salaries, all the contractor payments, all the software tools, anything that went into building your product is gonna need to be itemized and submitted to your valuation partner. \n\nBut don't forget the balance sheet. A lot of times companies will buy big capital expenditures, like big machines or things like that. And that also needs to be included in the cost to recreate. I would even go a step farther on a balance sheet item, which is the prepaid expenses. If your company has signed a bunch of licenses from software providers or tool providers they need, then I would also include those, even though some of them are capitalized on the balance sheet. \n\nSo once you get all these expenses from the life of the company tabulated, hand those over to your valuation partner, you're gonna probably wanna go over them and answer a bunch of questions for them 'cause they don't know your company as well as you do. So once you get that valuation back from your partner, probably take five to 10 days. You will be able to price all your employees stock options. They will be happy, you'll be happy and you'll be all set. \n\nI hope that explanation on the cost to recreate for 409A valuations was helpful. Thanks.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHi, guys, I'm Vanessa with Kruze Consulting and today I wanted to take a little bit of time to talk to you more about R&D tax credits for startups. \n\nThe big question that we get is, how do I claim the R&D tax credit payroll offset? And the answer is to follow these steps. \n\nFirst and foremost, and this is so important, make sure that you work with a startup CPA. I can't even tell you how many companies I've seen that worked with Joe Schmo down the street or someone who didn't specialize in the R&D tax credit and they wound up either with no R&D tax credit study or kind of shoddy work and then they missed out on tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings. So please make sure that you work with someone who's really familiar with startups and someone who knows R&D tax credits well. \n\nA quick kind of publicity plug, we here at Kruze, we only work with startups and we do an amazing job on these types of R&D tax credit studies. \n\nSo, second, you're definitely gonna want to file the R&D tax credit with your startup CPA on form 6765. That's known as the credit for increasing research activities and it's actually a form that goes with your annual tax return. It's the big tax return that's actually known as the 1120. So, just know that it's kind of a subset of that major tax return that you file once a year. \n\nAnd then finally once you filed your tax return, and it's been accepted with the IRS, you're going to have to go back to your payroll provider and claim the R&D tax credit on payroll tax form 941. We absolutely love Gusto they've made it totally easy but just about every other payroll processor out there should be able to help. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to reach out to me. I'm Vanessa with Kruze.",

And so we wanted to just do a video, explaining the strengths of SVB, so people in the startup community, I think people already kind of know it, but we figured we'd help them get the message out a little bit. So a lot of people don't know but SVB is still relatively young. It was founded in 1982, so almost about 40 years old. But from the beginning, they had a really big focus on startup and entrepreneurs. That was like the big bet behind the bank. And you can look at their market cap. It really, really paid off. I think they had about $70 billion worth of assets, like deposits, loans they own things like that at the end of 2019. So, it's not a small bank anymore. It's had huge growth. It's a big institution. And I think the reason why Kruze really likes SVB it's really is kind of three things. First, it has just a complete product suite. \n\nSVB really offers every product or service a startup or someone in the startup community could want. They provide wire services, bill pay, stuff like that, that startups are gonna need. And then one of their big differentiators is venture debt. \n\nAcross the country there's not many banks that actually want to lend money to startups or companies that are losing money. It's really hard I mean, think about it. A bank, SVB is too, is federally regulated. \n\nThe other thing about SVB is they do a lot of like personal banking things that help entrepreneurs or help team members, or even help venture capitalists. \n\nAnd then the final product suite to talk about is just the fact that they serve venture capital funds, too. They have a big fund money management business. They are also known for helping and introducing big LPs. \n\nThe next thing is just a big emphasis on customer support. So if you're a startup working with SVB, you're gonna have an account manager assigned to you. \n\nAnd then I think the other thing we like about them on the customer support side is they do think about the accounting firms like Kruze Consulting.  \n\nAnd so it's really nice that SVB has all that stuff. It just makes their customer support a lot better. Now, the final thing we'll talk about is just, SVB has proven that they are fast movers and they're really good at filling holes in their product line. A good example, we talked about credit cards a little bit, but the old SVB credit card system was just not that great. Support wasn't very good. The rewards were really poor. There were personal guarantees and Brex came into the market. And I think Brex did some damage in the first couple years, but SVB responded with their SVB Innovator's card, which is a tailor-made credit card for startups. There's no personal guarantee. They really increased the rewards. Most importantly, the customer support and integration into the rest of the SVB banking portal is so much better. It used to be such a nightmare trying to connect the old SVB credit card system to QuickBooks, and we'd have a bunch of errors and a bunch of problems. And so the SVB Innovator's card is a really good example of that. \n\nAnother one people don't really realize, but Stripe was founded and runs on SVB's payment rails. I mean, they are responsible for helping one of the biggest payment innovators in all of Silicon Valley in the tech industry, get there. Without that partnership with Stripe, without the partnership with SVB, Stripe would have probably had a really difficult time getting going in early days. And then the final thing on just improving their systems is they've invested a lot of money. They've even done some acquires and bought some small startups to make their portal and all the data connections so much easier to work with if you're an accountant.",

      "title": "First Republic Bank",
      "description": "First Republic Bank.\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nFirst Republic is one of the dominant banks in the startup category that we focus on, and so I thought it'd be helpful for everyone to know First Republic's strengths and why people like working with them, and so the first one and definitely the single most important reason people like First Republic is they have phenomenal customer service like white glove, call you back in 10 minutes, get it done no matter what, type of customer service and that's, as I'm an entrepreneur myself and so as an entrepreneur and someone who works with a ton of entrepreneurs, I really, really value that. \n\nNow there's some other great things about First Republic, though. They've made a really big investment into their mobile apps. \n\nThe next one is old fashioned, but they have branches. It sounds kind of silly to say in this day and age, but having a branch you can walk into and make a deposit or handle a wire at the last minute, or even if you need to, you shouldn't really be doing this if you're a startup, but withdrawing cash or things like that is actually really helpful. \n\nNow there's a couple other things in that they do some ancillary services for startups or founders or employees of startups that are really, really helpful. The two being mortgages, and if you're working in the startup ecosystem, odds are, you're not like maximizing your pay. Like you could probably be making more money at a bigger company, but you've chosen to help build something and change the world, and so you typically, there's a little bit of a trade-off on salary and you usually get some equity alongside of that, and so first Republic understands the trade-off that founders make and employees make on salary and so they're very, very flexible on margins. \n\nNow they're not gonna underwrite a mortgage that you can't afford, but there's just a lot more wiggle room and again, that customer focus really comes into play there. So that's really, really helpful, especially if you're a founder and you've probably been paying yourself under market for three or four years. That is a huge differentiator if you're trying to buy a house. Another thing along those lines is student loan financing. They, First Republic has a really aggressive student loan financing or refinancing program for startup employees, and I know a bunch of Kruze Consulting team members have taken advantage of that. It's really, really low interest rates, and basically they're using the halo of the company that you work with. \n\nLike they know you're working with a good company or good startup, and so that factors into their underwriting criteria and allows them to be a lot more aggressive on the student loans. So I know we've made numerous announcements at Kruze that the First Republic student loan financing program is something that everyone should investigate, and a bunch of people have taken advantage of that. \n\nNow there's another aspect of First Republic that startup founders and employees don't always think about, but it's actually very important. They have a huge fund management practice, meaning they manage the capital, the bank accounts, the capital call loans for tons of venture capital funds, and so that creates a really nice synergy in that they know all the fund managers, all the VCs, you're trying to get their attention or trying to get a meeting with them. \n\nFirst Republic usually has a one-to-one relationship with them. In fact, they probably did their capital call loan, and they may even have done their mortgage and their fund probably has their cash sitting at First Republic, and so they can go above and beyond and make some really high value intros for you. There's also just a nice little synergy when the VC knows that their companies are banking at First Republic. So I really, it's kind of an under the radar thing, but having that fund management, fund practice at First Republic is really beneficial to really everyone in the startup ecosystem. \n\nSo those are the big things, but I really wanna come back to people as we wrap it up to just that customer centric approach. It is again, above and beyond really anything I've experienced in the banking industry and I would put it up there with the top, Nordstrom's, Neiman Marcus, Southwest Airlines, all the companies that you read about that are really famous for their customer service, First Republic is at that level and should be mentioned in the same breath as those top tier companies across the world that take customer service really, really important. \n\nSo I hope that helps, check out First Republic, we really like them at Kruze and it's just a great bank to work with, thanks.",

      "description": "Rho Banking.\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm telling you about one of my favorite new startup tools, which is Rho Banking. \n\nRho is a banking app that a lot of startups are using. And the reason why I like Rho, is that it's built by serial entrepreneurs. Like these people have built companies before, so they really kinda know what, like a founder thinks about and worries about and what they need from their bank. The company is based out of New York. So they're right in like the startup flow of New York. And they do have a lot of Silicon Valley clients too. but, they just kind of get it, they've lived it. \n\nNow they've built a really beautiful interface. Like it's just so easy to use. It's almost like feeding your eyes cookies. Like it's just so nice to just look at it and navigate around. Very easy, very different from like your typical bank login experience. So I really like Rho for that. They also have a really great savings interest rate. So they're very generous on this. That number changes a lot, but they're always significantly higher than kind of the old school banks. The other thing I like about them is, they have FDIC insurance over all your deposits. So typically there's a $250,000 limit for each account on FDIC insurance. \n\nBut they basically built a little bit of technology that splits. You don't see this, but it splits your money. You know, you might raise 10, $20 million in a startup. You want all that to be insured. So it splits your money into micro accounts and makes sure everything is insured, which is pretty huge. And then the kind of clincher for me is that they are building basically an accounts payable solution inside of the bank. And so typically our clients use bill.com. But a lot of times bill.com is kind of tough to learn. It's not the most easy interface, it's kind of industrial strength. And so the early stage founders are kind of like, \"Do I really need to use bill.com? Do I really need to spend a lot of time using this?\" And it's not always super intuitive. \n\nAnd so Rho is effectively replacing bill.com in that flow, and making it super easy to pay your vendors, to store the invoices, to label the transactions, and make sure they sync into QuickBooks, which makes our life a lot easier. That invoice aspect of it is really important. We need to be able to check the invoices, to see which months the service from your contractors was provided. Because if we don't know the months, we can't do accrual accounting and gap based accounting correctly. It just becomes like ugly cash accounting, which is not what you want and which makes your financials lumpy. So Rho is really pioneering, like this bill pay aspect inside of the bank. \n\nAnd I'm just super excited about it. Like it's a really beautiful, easy to use solution, but it's got some real business applications that can save you time as a founder, make it a little easier, and frankly, save your accountant like us a lot of time. So check out Rho. It's R-H-O.co and it has an app interface as well. So check it out, we really like it. \n\nAnd shout out to Rho. Great job team for building a really great solution. I love recommending new things that make everyone's life a lot easier. Thanks.",

      "description": "How does a secondary transaction get reported on ASC 718 Stock Option Expense?\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today we're answering the question how does a secondary transaction get reported on ASC 718 stock option expense? \n\nNow, that is a mouthful but it's really, really important for founders who are doing secondary sales. So the quick answer is a secondary transaction should not impact your ASC 718 reporting. That's a negative. It should not impact it. It potentially can impact your 409a going forward. The logic there being if there's a market made in the common stock that's far above what the 409a valuation is, people need to take a hard look at the situation and think well, hey, is that 409a accurate enough? Is it outdated? Should we be getting a new 409a if other people are willing to pay a lot more for that common stock than what the stock option price is determined by the 409a? So that's not always the case. \n\nOftentimes, investors who are buying common stock in a secondary transaction and are paying more than the 409a evaluation, which is recent, could have different motives for paying up. Maybe it is a company they were not able to get into via preferred stock transactions, like the VCs just got boxed out. And so they'll kind of like pay whatever it takes, kind of irrationally almost to get into some common at least. \n\nAlso, there are times where this is kind of the negative situation but there's a founder who is just not kind of executing or not getting along with the team or something like that and so there's a premium put on buying that founder's shares so that you can kind of get them out of the way or get them out of the company. And so that way, the founder who may isn't getting along with everyone still walks away with proceeds and a lot of value and then the team can concentrate and not have to really worry about maybe a personality issue or something like that. \n\nSo those are some of the reasons why people would pay more than the 409a valuation and you could rationalize why it shouldn't be impacting the future 409a valuation. But again, this is a good one to talk to your lawyer about, this is a good one to talk to your accountant firm, like Kruze about and a good one to talk to your valuation provider about because there's always extenuating circumstances in these situations but the big takeaway is that a secondary's just not gonna impact your ASC 718 reporting. That's the good news for you. \n\nYou can sleep well at night and if you have any questions on this, feel free to hit Kruze up. kruzeconsulting.com and we have our dedicated tax team and will be happy to help you on this, thanks.",

      "description": "Steps to shut down a startup\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nI hope that you never have to go through this, but a lot of the best entrepreneurs take a shot, build a company, it doesn't work out, and they live to fight again and create another company and they go on to a lot of success. So if you're watching this video because you're shutting a company down, I'm sorry. A lot of empathy for entrepreneurs at Kruze. We're entrepreneurs ourself. But I also just want to explain to you how to shut down a company appropriately so that you don't have any bad ramifications down the road. I always like to remember that in the bowels of the IRS and the bowels of the state governments or states, those states you're working in with your startup, your social security number is somewhere attached to the EIN and the state numbers for your company. And so doing the final tax returns, dissolving the company, putting it to bed correctly will save you a lot of headache. \n\nI get a lot of emails, nightmare emails from entrepreneurs where like the state of California is still auto debiting their personal bank account three years later, because the state of California thinks they should be filing a tax return every year and they're not paying their state franchise tax. So this happens a lot, not a ton, but you want to do this correctly, shut down the company correctly, so here's how you do it. First thing you're going to do, file a final tax return. This is a federal and state tax return. Sometimes municipalities like New York City actually require a final municipal tax return, too. They all kind of flow off the federal return, so just make sure your accountant or CPA is actually doing the final tax return. \n\nSometimes companies run out of money and don't have enough money to pay for the final tax return. It's sad, but sometimes those situations have to come out of the founder's pocket. You never like to see that. So right before you're about to run out of money, make sure you reserve some money to wind down the company correctly, but you're going to do that final tax return because the IRS and the state governments and maybe municipality. \n\nThe next thing you're going to do is do a Delaware certificate of dissolution. So you actually have to fill this out, mail it in. Your lawyer will probably do this for you, but you can do it too, it's not too hard. There's some samples on Delaware's website, pretty easy to do. You're also going to file your final Delaware franchise tax report. And so for this, you need your cap table, your up-to-date financials, because you're going to need the asset value on your balance sheet. You're also going to need the shares outstanding. That's why you need your cap table. \n\nAnd you're going to go into the Delaware franchise tax website. You're going to fill in all that material, and then you're going to click final filing. And so there's like a little button there, very easy to do. Pro tip, when you fill all that information in and you click the recalculate button, give it a couple of seconds. Sometimes people freak out. They email us or call us because Delaware's website says they owe like $40,000 or $100,000, but it's just they didn't hit the recalculate button. Sounds so simple until you're the person calling me with the complaint about the $40,000 franchise tax fine. If you're a tiny startup, it's going to be like $400, just to give some context if you're watching this video. You're also going to do... So, that's Delaware. \n\nYou're also going to need to do state dissolution. So for example, say you're operating in the state of California, New York, Texas, wherever you're operating. And quite possible these days, you're operating in a bunch of different states. You're going to need to file, again, the final tax return we talked about, but you're usually going to have to file like a form dissolution. So in California, there's a certificate of surrender you have to fill out. New York, Texas, all the other big states have something similar. So don't forget the other states though. You don't want them expecting a tax return every year and doing that auto debit thing on your bank account. You're also going to fill out an IRS dissolution application. It's form 966. So you can just actually type in IRS form 966, you'll see it. Not too complicated. Something, typically, your accountant will fill that out for you, but if you need to do it yourself, you can do it. \n\nAnd then the final thing you're going to need to do is compute and prepare the liquidating distribution if there's anything to liquidate in the form 1099-DIV. So you're going to want to get that out. This is like, say, you're shutting down with another million dollars in cash or even $100,000 in cash, whatever it is, you're going to redistribute that back out to investors to make them as whole as possible. Always a good thing to do.",

      "description": "Can you backdate payroll?\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question, should your startup backdate payroll? \n\nAnd my emphatic answer is no. Please do not do this. Please do not backdate any payrolls for any reason. And the reason is you do not wanna run into compliance problems with the IRS. I know it seems so simple just to run those payrolls on a, you know, historical date and everyone gets paid and you're catching up with money you owed people and things like that. But, the IRS takes payroll taxes very seriously. That's one of the main revenue drivers of our country of any state, of any municipality. \n\nAnd so if you start backdating payroll, you're gonna run to a problem because all the payroll providers file payroll tax quarterly reports with the federal government and the States. For the federal, I think it's a 941 is the form. And basically any time you are going in and backdating payroll after that 941 form is filed with the federal government, you are sending contradictory information to your payroll provider and to the IRS and the payroll provider is gonna report it. Like the payroll provider is not gonna get in trouble with the IRS on your behalf because you want to run payroll historically. \n\nSo please do not do that. Please, it's gonna create a ton of problems. People don't know, but payroll penalties, payroll tax penalties create a lot of problems for companies and it's a lot of paperwork. It's a lot of like time spent on hold with the IRS or trying to catch up or paying a specialist to handle those payroll tax re-filings. So please don't do this. Now, one thing... The use case I see this most with startup founders is they don't wanna take payroll until they raise capital, which makes sense. There's no money in the bank really anyways, to pay them. And so what they do, the logic is like, well, hey, I've been spending three to six months raising money. So I raised money and now I'm gonna pay myself for those three to six months in the past. \n\nAnd again, I totally get the logic and it makes perfect sense, but again, backdating the payroll is gonna cause problems with IRS. So what I would recommend on the front end, right when you start working with a company and you know you're gonna do this, put it into your contract that you're gonna get a bonus when you raise the capital. So instead of like running a back payroll you're actually gonna be in compliance with the IRS because you're collecting that bonus payment that's in your contract. \n\nIt's very important to have this in your contract as, you know or an agreement with the board or something like that, that's documented ahead of time so that you can show the IRS that you weren't just playing around and ran a bonus payroll for six months of retroactive payroll. You wanna have this all documented properly. But if that's in your contract you have the agreement with the board, you do raise the cash, then it's perfectly fine to run a bonus payment for the successful raising of capital. And now you're gonna be running your normal payroll. \n\nSo that scenario addresses the most frequent use case of why people are trying to run payroll retroactively. There's probably some other reasons that I can't really think of right now, or aren't super common but I think the big takeaway needs to be just please don't run retroactive payrolls. It's gonna get you in compliance problems. You're gonna spend less time building your startup and more time dealing with IRS or you gonna have to pay someone like Kruze to fix this stuff. \n\nAnd we don't really like fixing this stuff because it's a real pain and it's very intense for us. So please do it the right way. If you have any questions shoot us an email at kruzeconsulting.com. Always happy to answer payroll, payroll tax questions. And we can give you a little friendly advice if you need it. Hope that helps, thanks.",

Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nAnd I think it's really important to just state this upfront that no venture capitalist slash board member ever wants to fire the founder from a startup. You remember like those VCs went to their partnership and said, we have to invest in this person, their vision what they're creating is so amazing. We want to be a part of this and we can get a really great financial return on it. Right? So the people who are pulling the trigger on a termination of a founder, are doing it, not because they really want to, but because they kind of feel like they have to. And remember venture capitalists or board members are fiduciaries of the company. Like no matter how much they like the founder they have to look out for the company and for the shareholder value. And that's the definition of being a fiduciary. And so they're doing it. Not, they're not happy to be doing it. They don't want to do it. And frankly, anytime you're firing a founder, the odds of you as a VC making money on the company or the company having a good outcome are probably pretty low. \n\nSo the VCs know that. So this is only stuff that... it's like their hand has been forced. They feel like they have to make a change. And so the first and definitely the biggest is just like negative surprises in cash management. And this can be a couple of different things. This can be spending way too much money, way too fast. This could be misinforming the board about how long your cash runway actually is Or maybe you're so disorganized as a founder, unfortunately, that you actually don't know how much money you're spending. And so you're not just like surprising the VCs but you're surprising yourself. And so this is definitely the biggest thing. Like the venture capitalists are financial people, they're writing a check. \n\nNow, if you're increasing your burn rate because the opportunity is so attractive or you missed a couple of quarters, but you're communicating with the VCs and the board members, that's different. Like that's not a surprise. The surprise is when they start questioning whether they can actually trust you as the founder or not. Another issue is recruiting. \n\nAnd, you know, venture capitalists or board members they will, if, executive team members leave they're going to call that executive team member up and get the scoop. Like they are not shy about getting that person's side of the, of the story. And so. If you're losing... You know, there's obviously always churn in employee ranks and executive ranks, but if there is a clear pattern of you losing your top executives at your company and it happens a couple of different times for the same positions the venture capitalists are going to ask what's going on and what's wrong. So that's another reason that could lead to termination. Falling short of milestones is another really, really big one. And just venture capitals have a lot of boards they sit on, they make a lot of investments. That's part of like, their business. That's part of their daily life. So they really depend on like the shorthand milestones that companies tell them. \n\nAnd achieving those milestones is really important because if they are achieved, the VCs know that the company will be able to raise more capital from other venture capitalists. And the venture capitalists will give you really good feedback on how real your milestones are. Are they going to be enough to raise money for the next round? And so when you come short, they know in their head a couple of things, the company has missed our numbers. They missed the target they're supposed to be hitting. And also when that happens, they're probably going to have to write another check to kinda of jump in and help save the company. \n\nA lot of times it's in the form of a bridge loan. And so if you're missing your milestones repeatedly, almost by definition, you're going, it means you're going back to the investors asking for more cash. And so, again, that's one of those things. And if you're missing your milestones you're just not gonna be able to get outside VCs interested in the company. And so that's another reason they might make a change. And the final, big reason is hopefully obvious these days but just harassment or tolerating a culture of harassment. I think people understand that it's not appropriate for harassment to happen in the workplace at all. \n\nBut if you're a founder or CEO and you maybe you're not harassing people directly but you're tolerating or facilitating a culture of harassment, that's just as bad as actually doing it.",

      "description": "Quick Guide to Matching Assets to Debt\n\nRaising venture debt? Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt\n\nThis is especially important for startups that are buying some type of asset and will get a payback period from their customer. So good examples would be like companies that buy tablets and load software on them or robotics companies or agricultural robotics companies. There's a lot of hard asset companies out there and they're leveraging both their technical acumen and building these robots or tablets or whatever it is, but also loading a ton of software. \n\nAnd it's really kind of a hardware plus software play. But because there is hardware involved, you do want to most likely finance that hardware. So, the idea is you take equity from venture capitalists to pay salaries and burn, all that kind of stuff. But you can take debt out to help kind of augment your cash runway, extend your cash runway, and you can do that and finance your hardware. So a good example might be like a robotics company that has to buy either the parts or they buy a robot from an OEM in Asia, and then they make some customizations and load their software on it. And once they sell it to the customer, it's a six month payback period, right? \n\nAnd so, in my example, you might start thinking about this and say like, \"We just need a six month revolver.\" A revolver's the kind of debt that you can draw down and payback at your option as a startup. And so you go to the bank, SVB or TriplePoint or WTI, Bridge Bank, some of the big lenders that we work with and you request a revolver loan. And this makes perfect sense. You then use that, you draw down the money on the debt, you pay the person that you're buying it from and then the cash from the customer that's using the robot goes back and pays the lender. \n\nBut that's only looking at kind of a one-time purchase of the hardware. Most of our companies, all of our companies, are hopefully growing. And so their kind of unit of growth is usually measured in those robots, in those tablets, whatever those hard assets are that they're selling to clients. And so you're gonna start assuming that month one, you buy a few robots and month two, you're gonna sell a few more, and month three, you're gonna sell even more and so on and so on because you're building a company to grow. And so you start moving your mentality from a revolver that matches that one single cash outlay to something like term debt, because term debt is gonna cover all the different outlays you have as you grow. \n\nAnd so just kind of visualize multiple schedules of paybacks out there. And the nice thing about term debt is you can typically negotiate a forward-looking commitment, which means that the lender will typically give you something like 6 months to 12 months, sometimes even 18 months to draw down and use that debt. And so, as you're making these purchases of hard assets for your company, all you do is every time, within reason, you don't wanna micromanage this, but maybe every three months or every six months, you make a new draw down on your term debt, it will match the cash outflow that's going to the OEM you're buying the robots or tablets or whatever from. \n\nAnd then you'll have your own amortization period for each draw down term debt. And the nice thing about term debt is they almost always, and you should negotiate this, have a very friendly prepayment clause. And so if your company is just kicking butt and you have a really nice bluebird inbound VC term sheet for a ton of money, and all of a sudden you're gonna have so much money that you don't even really need to use debt for awhile, then you can turn around and use that new equity you're raising and pay down all of those term debt outstanding and save a little bit of money on interest. \n\nAnd you know what, because you raised so much money and your company's doing so well, you're probably gonna get an ultra generous, aggressive offer from whoever your term lender is to do a longer interest-only period and a longer draw down period. 'Cause they're gonna wanna stay in the game. You are a company that's working and everyone wants to get money into good companies because that's how the lenders make money, that's how the VCs make money. \n\nAnd so I think just the big picture, revolvers are a really good match for those assets, if it's a one-time purchase. But again, almost all the startups we work with at Kruze are gonna be making a series of asset purchases. And so term debt actually becomes the better match for that asset. I hope that helps. I know it's a little bit of a complex concept, but we're here at Kruze to help you out if you have questions on venture debt and how you should optimize the debt you're raising to match your assets. Hope that helps, thanks, bye.",

      "title": "3 Factors slowing VC investment into startups",
      "description": "Hey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're talking about three factors that are slowing startup investment by VCs, and we're right in the middle of the COVID-19 situation, so this is an up to date market report here. But, there's three things that are really happening. \nThe first is venture capitalists have big portfolios of existing companies, and so when there's a crisis, they spend a ton of time working on their existing portfolio, helping those companies survive, so they're in a lot of board meetings doing things like maybe redoing the operating model or maybe doing headcount reductions or just strategizing on how to get into a different market, and also maybe strategizing on how to raise more money. And so, VCs are essentially distracted from doing new deals right now because they're doing their job. They're working with their existing portfolio companies. That's what you want them to do, but it does slow down the amount of new deals they can do. \nThe second factor is capital calls become more difficult in tough times like now. Now, thankfully, the stock market has recovered from the March and early April reductions, and so now the asset basis for all the pension funds and endowments is back up pretty much to where it was. So, capital calls are not as painful as they were maybe two or three weeks ago. When the market goes down a lot, it's very difficult for the foundations, endowments, pension funds to fund the capital calls. They will do it. They're contractually obligated to do it, but that means they're selling stuff at the bottom. They don't like selling assets for low prices either, just like you and I, and so when VC firms submit their capital calls, that means they're selling an asset to fund that capital call, and so they're much happier funding that capital call when things are good, the stock market is up because they're liquid and they're not taking a price discount. So, in March and April, when things were really tough in the stock market, they were not super happy. Again, they were funding capital calls, but they might've had some words or maybe told the GPs to be a little more conservative. Now, venture capitalists, it's not really in their best interest to talk about that. They're not gonna publicly advertise that their LP said slow down the capital calls. But, that does happen. I've been through it. I worked at a venture capital fund. I've seen it happen. It definitely happens. The LPs are really, as a VC, your customer, and so you're gonna do what they want. You're gonna be very respectful of that relationship. \nThe third thing that's slowing down venture capital investing right now is price discovery. We just don't know, no one in the legal system knows what a company is worth today versus we had a pretty good idea where the economy was six months ago, pre-COVID. The stock market was working. It was efficient. We could see that valuations for SATS companies usually traded in like a five to 10 X revenue multiple. That's kinda what the market was, for example, SATS companies. But, VCs had a pretty good idea of what a series A should go for and how much capital should be raised in a series B and a series C, and so on.\nNow, with COVID, there's so much confusion and diversions in a company's performance and the stock market isn't super rational right now either that venture capitalists don't have a good feel for what the true valuation of a company would be. And so, if they get too aggressive, they may look foolish down the road. Say someone gives a super aggressive term sheet to a hot company right now, they may feel, you know, a little bit silly down the road because their LPs may really ask them what they were thinking doing such an aggressive deal in times of COVID. And so, venture capitalists are in this process along with founders of price discovery. \nEveryone is doing a lot of negotiations and trying to figure out what the new prices for series A, series B, even angel investments are, and that takes a little while to work out. It takes some stability in the stock market. It's a lot easier, if the market's lower, it's just easier if it stays a bit lower for a while for people to get used to the new reality. When it's bouncing around with thousands of points drops and increases, it's very confusing to everybody. So, venture capitalists, they're fiduciary. They're fiduciary for the funds that invested in them, and so they wanna make sure they do a good job and make sure they get in at a fair price, and so price discovery is what's holding up some of the deals too. So, just to recap, the work on existing portfolio companies is taking a lot of time. The trying to be conservative on capital calls is also slowing down investment, and the third thing is price discovery. \nOnce we get to a more stable time, even if COVID is still a factor in our life, those three things will settle down and venture capitalists will start doing more deals. Hope that helps, thanks.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nRaising venture debt? Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're talking about how the stock market influences the venture capital market, and this is a really important topic right now, because we're in the middle of COVID-19. \n\nThere's a ton of volatility in the stock market, and there's a ton of fear in the venture capital and startup communities, 'cause we don't know what's gonna happen. And so I thought it'd be helpful to just walk through how funds get their money from big institutional investors, and how institutional investors like foundations are influenced by the stock market. \n\nNow, foundations and endowments like Stanford, MIT, Berkeley; or pension funds like Verizon; or big, old-school companies with huge pension fund really make up the bulk of the capital that goes into the venture capital market. And the reason why is: they have huge asset portfolios. They've got money in the stock market, they've gone in the bond market, and they a long time ago realized that if they put money in asset classes like private equity and venture capital, they could actually outperform to some degree. \n\nBut, they only have so much to go into those asset classes, 'cause they're fairly risky relative to the stock market and bond market, and they're not very liquid. So typically, a foundation, endowment, pension fund will allocate something like 20 to 30% of their total assets into alternative assets.\n\nNow, it could be more. There's a whole conversation around Yale and the way they do things, and they're way more aggressive with allocation to alternative investments. But for our work here, just kind of figure 20%, 30%. And so, let's take a really big endowment, foundation, pension fund, let's say, we're just gonna make some numbers up here. They have $100 billion in assets, and they're going to allocate 20% of that to alternative investments. That's $20 billion. Now, and that's with the stock market kind of doing what it does. \n\nNow, let's imagine the stock market goes down quite a bit, like we've experienced lately, and maybe it's a 20% haircut. All of a sudden, the assets that are liquid are worth a lot less for that pension fund, endowment. Maybe their total assets now are $80 billion. But they had already allocated 20% of the 100 billion to alternative assets. That means they have a $20 billion allocation but their total assets are only 80 billion now. Now their allocation is 25%. So you can fumble the math and see how, just by the stock market going down, and that means that the allocation of alternative assets has actually gone way up for that pension fund or endowment. So now they have a problem: they can't make new allocations for a while, until either the stock market goes up or they get a lot more capital back from their alternative investments. \n\nAnd right now, there's not very many IPOs happening, there's not really big buyouts happening because it's such a tough market, so they're not going to get money back from their investments in the near term, so the only lever they really have is either hope the stock market goes up again, or they can't really make new commitments for a while. And so, we saw this in 2008, 2009, 2010. The pension funds, endowments were very slow to make new commitments to venture capital funds, or private equity funds, but mostly venture capital, because they were overweighted. The people who managed those portfolios at the pension fund, endowment are just handcuffed. They can't do anything 'cause they're overweight. \n\nSo, if you're wondering what's going to happen to the venture capital market, and really by default the startup ecosystem, watch the stock market. This may be like a total obvious observation for some people, but it really is, these machinations really matter, and so if the stock market recovers, like it has temporarily now, in April, and hopefully it sticks, then endowments and foundations will continue to make new commitments, they'll continue to fund new venture capital funds, and again, that capital will rush into the startup ecosystem. Which is great, that's how it's been for a very long time. If the stock market has a setback and goes down again, those pension funds, endowments will find themselves overallocated, potentially for the long term, and have to let their portfolio kind of run off, and wait for distributions to come back before they can make new commitments. \n\nSo we're in a really interesting moment here, and I hope this little tutorial on how endowments, pension funds make their allocations, and how that affects the venture capital market, helps you out. Thanks! Bye. Cool.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm covering the most effective Shopify software stack. So, at Kruze we have a lot of e-commerce companies that we do accounting for. And so we see a bunch of different Shopify configurations. \n\nNow, the most important part of the Shopify stack is actually Shopify. So we highly recommend you use that when you're running an e-commerce operation. \n\nNow, the next thing is Affirm, which is allowing installment payments. So when customers come to your site, they can actually buy things over time using Affirm. That's kind of nice. Most people like to use credit cards. But there's some people who wanna pay in installments. And so Affirm makes that possible. \n\nNow, the next one is Кlаviуо, which is doing email marketing. We've seen companies have a lot of success using Кlаviуо, so check that out. \n\nSo the next one after Кlаviуо is Octane AI. And Octane does a bunch of really cool features that plug into your Shopify environment. And the core thing with Octane is, it really helps you engage your customers when they're on your shop. But it also allows you to reach them via SMS or Messenger when they're off your shop. So, the quizzes and things like that really help drive engagement. And when people are engaged, they just tend to buy more. And then the ability to reach them later, when they're not on your shop, really can drive increased purchases as well. So definitely check out Octane AI. \n\nNow, the next one is ReCharge. That's a great solution for billing for subscription products. So we really like ReCharge. It's a great solution there. \n\nThe next one is a bunch of different apps that we like for reviews. So Okendo, Yotpo, Stamped, those are all good review applications to plug in to Shopify. And then, you can also do, for loyalty programs, check out Smile, or Swell. Those are two really good loyalty programs that work well in the Shopify environment. \n\nAnd then finally, Kruze. We actually do all the accounting for e-commerce companies. And we have about 70% of our transactions are actually recognized automatically by our in-house software. So, we're adding ourselves to the Shopify stack. It really does help to have a good accountant if you're running an e-commerce operation. You actually know what your gross margin is, you know what your inventory tracking is, you know what your revenue is. And most of all you know what your profits are. \n\nSo that's our favorite Shopify stack. Now others may have different opinions. But we know all of those applications work really, really well. It's gonna simplify your life. It's gonna increase your revenue. And frankly, it's just gonna make your life a lot easier. So hopefully you'll like those. Check 'em out. And let us know how they work. Thanks, bye.",

      "description": "How Startups Should Maximize Amazon AWS Free Credits\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today I'm answering the question, \"How should a startup manage its Amazon free credits?\" \n\nThis is currency. The Amazon credits are like the lifeblood of a lot of startups. Everyone loves them. It's like candy on Halloween, right? And for Amazon it actually works really well. Like companies are able to experiment on AWS, get used to it, get their applications deployed or scaling them. So, for Amazon, it's an amazing loss-leader, so they love giving out credits. But, I get this question a lot from startups, like, \"How are we supposed to manage this? How do we maximize our credits?\" is a big thing. So there's really kind of two paths. The first path is, if you've gone through Y Combinator or Techstars, or like a Tier 1 VC firm, you can ask and receive $100,000 worth of free credits. You will get that. \n\nThere's one catch though, in that you only have a year to spend those credits, and the lifetime cap of AWS credits is $100,000. So you basically are getting it all up front, and you only have a year. Now the tricky part about this is a lot of early stage startups actually can't spend $100,000 a year, because they don't have the customer usage to drive the use of their Amazon credits up, and so they end up having 50, 60, $70,000 worth of credits expire, they can never get those credits back, and they didn't maximize that. \n\nSo the way I prefer, with the $100,000 lifetime credits limit in mind, is start slow, get five or $10,000 worth of credits, and you can get this through Amazon and you get this through incubators, there's a bunch of different ways, and then once you use those, go up another 10K and then you go up another 10K, and you're at 25, and then the grants can actually start getting bigger. \n\nAnd then you can hit up the Y Combinator, Techstars, Tier 1 VC, whoever you know in that world, and get the big giant grant that will take you from maybe like 20 or 30,000 that you've already used, up to the 100K. But at that point, you're actually able to use that incremental big chunk of credits. So I'm basically saying, take it slow. It's, kind of, like ordering a pizza, you're not gonna try to eat the pizza all in one sitting, right? So order a slice, order another slice, order another slice, and you'll actually get way more usage out of it. \n\nThat way, if you do the incremental approach, you are not going to waste a bunch of credits. So, we do a lot of work with Amazon. Always happy to introduce you to them if you're a startup that's looking for credits, but, please, just be careful, and don't go for the $100,000 credits right away, unless you are absolutely positive you can use those credits. \n\nHope that helps, if you have any questions hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com. Thanks!",

Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHi. It's Scott. Today we're doing a VentureNet scavenging report on Western Technology Investments, better known as WTI. WTI has been around for I think about 30 years. They're one of the major players in the VentureNet market, and they specialize in doing very large deals and very flexible deals. As WTI will tell you, they actually let you use the money. There are no covenants, there's not material versus change clauses, there are not investor abandonment clauses. They are aggressive, they will give you a big capital commitment, and they'll let you use it. The only downsides to WTI are they typically are more expensive than other players in the market. They have a higher interest rate and higher warrant coverage. But hey, they actually let you use the money, so they're actually getting compensated for the risk they're taking. We love our team that we work with over there. Maurice Whitaker, Patrick Lee, Rudy Wano, they are great people to work with, they've done a ton of deals, and tons of experience, and have been around Silicon Valley for a long time. So, in summary, WTI is definitely someone you want to check out if you're doing a VentureNet deal. They tend to be more flexible, but also more expensive. But that extra money and the ability to actually use the capital and not get hemmed in by a lender is really, really valuable. So, we highly recommend them. Thanks!",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts\n\n- The first one is convertible debt, and this is kind of like the oldest approach. Convertible debt comes in as debt, but it's really designed to convert into equity when there are larger rounds. So typically, this is angel and early stage VC funds are gonna invest in this. Sometimes there's a very small interest rate attached, maybe 2, 3% interest rate, and there's typically a term of something like 18 to 24 months at which point the convertible debt is due. However in practice, almost all investors roll that over if the startup needs more time, but it is debt, it does come out first if the company's ever liquidated or sold. And so it is something that investors do like to invest in, convertible debt. \n\n- SAFE notes are the next iteration of how VCs invest in startups. And this is something that was popularized by Y Combinator, and they wanted something that was a little more friendly than convertible notes. So SAFE notes, they are not technically debt, they are technically equity. However, there is a new movement, probably in the last year or two, where SAFE notes do have that priority repayment feature that's basically typical in convertible notes, meaning if there's liquidation, company gets sold, the SAFE notes do get paid out first. The SAFE notes typically do not have interest rates associated with it, so there's no compounding there. And typically they do not have a term, they just kind of run on and on and on until there's a conversion event. They do have that conversion cap. So that same example where I talked about like a $10 million valuation on the convert would be the same thing for the SAFE note and then when the Series A or a bigger round comes in, they will get to convert at that favorable valuation. So that's SAFE notes. \n\n- Some other important terms of preferred are some of the voting rights stuff. So sometimes, voting rights around acquisitions or around financial plans or venture debt or even management appointees is made either on a as-converted basis, meaning all the shareholders vote based on their total ownership percentage as if the shares were all converted to the common or sometimes it can be on a share class vote, meaning the Series A investors, they have to approve any initiative specifically between them. And typically what this kinda does is creates like almost like a blocking right for those investors. So the nightmare scenario for a VC is they invest in a company, and two weeks later the management team wants to sell the company. \n\n- Some other little things around preferred stock, even participating preferred, which means, which is pretty rare these days, but it used to happen where VCs would get their liquidation preference back, that 1X back, plus they would then get to participate in all the upside alongside the common. The typical structure of preferred equity is that you either get your liquidation preference back, or you have to convert into something like common and everyone shares in the proceeds. Now the final instrument VCs use to invest is highly structured preferred, and this is typically at the very late stage kinda unicorn-style companies, and it's typically used when late stage companies do not wanna do a valuation write down. So they, maybe they raise money at a $500 million valuation. They don't wanna go below that. They need to raise more money, so they create a highly-structured instrument that late stage investors can invest in. And what this typically is, is a much higher interest, almost like a dividend rate or an interest rate associated with that preferred, and it's gonna compound at a much higher rate.",

Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHi, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're talking about Square 1 Bank. This is your scouting report for Square 1 Bank and their venture debt services. So, first of all, we work with two great people there, Laurie Lumenti and Jeff Griffor. Jeff's on the East Coast. Laurie's on the West Coast. They're both seasoned professionals, been doing venture debt for a very long time. They know their stuff, and they're great to work with. Now, for Square 1, Square 1's actually an interesting story. They were a startup bank, and then recently they were acquired by a much larger bank, so their balance sheet is much bigger, and they can do much bigger deals, more creative deals, and get in there where maybe they got priced out of or couldn't quite compete in the past. So they're much more aggressive now, great bank to work with. Now, like all other banks, some of the negatives with Square 1 is they typically use an investor abandonment clause or a MAC clause, something to mitigate their risk in a downsizing situation. So, if you're working with a bank, any bank really, but Square 1 does this, be careful of the MAC, be careful of the investor abandonment clause. On the positive side, banks like Square 1 typically have a low cost of capital, low warrant coverage, and they provide other services like your banking, housing your cash, things like that. They'll pay if you need it. So in summary, Square 1's a great venture debt partner. Laurie and Jeff are terrific to work with, and they offer the same typical bank value proposition, which is low cost to capital, but there's a little downside in that you got to be careful of the MAC and investor abandonment clause. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

Super important. Also important to the mental health of your CPA firm, because we need it to do your taxes properly. \n\nSo, when you start getting to be bigger as a startup, the states want to start charging you sales tax. Also, the states that you're selling a lot in want to start having you file a state tax return. That is because you are, you have tax nexus in those states. Tax nexus is defined by having people, assets, property, or certain thresholds of revenue in a given state. And so, it's really important when we're filling out your tax returns, and doing it correctly, by the way, not everyone does this correctly, to get a breakdown of your revenue by state. And unfortunately, this is almost like we're trying to help you help us kind of video. \n\nA lot of startups don't track that, and it becomes a little messy, and it's hard for them, and it ends up delaying their tax returns, which creates a little stress for everybody, and also delays our ability to capture some of their R&D Tax Credits, and things like that because, filing tax returns later in the year, it's nice to get that money earlier, right? So, please use a CRM system, or an invoicing system that includes the addresses of your clients or customers. Super-duper important. Once you put a system like that in, I know we have that at Kruze. \n\nWe use Salesforce, thank goodness for Salesforce. But there's Pipedrive, and a lot of invoicing systems like QuickBooks Invoicing. I think Stripe has some fields for this too. Bill.com has this. Once you have that info, especially if it's flowing into your general accounting system, like QuickBooks Online, makes it so much easier to mine this data, and for us to determine the states you have nexus in. You really want to be up to date on nexus. You don't want to have to go back when you're doing venture capital due diligence, and the diligence firm that the VCs have hired, or the VC associates and principals are asking you these questions, and you can't give them a revenue by state report to validate that you were in tax compliance. \n\nBecause remember, when you go through VC diligence, and you sign on a dotted line, and take that money, you are making some pretty serious reps and warranties in the stock purchase agreement, and things like that. So just make sure that you have this. Again, if not, I've seen this many, many times, like hundreds of times, it's not for a lack of wanting to do it, it's for startups are constantly having to reprioritize stuff, and sometimes like a CRM system, or tracking this just gets deprioritized. \n\nBut believe me, if you can get this in, in the early days of your company, it will make everything so much easier, especially on the tax side. It'll also help you with like regional territory stuff, commission stuff, so it's a benefit in a lot of different places across your company, but it does make taxes a heck of a lot easier. \n\nSo hope that helps. If you have any other questions on this, or any other tax issues, hit us up at Kruze Consulting, your friendly CPA for startups, thanks!",

      "description": "How to Manage Accounting Complexities When You Have a Distributed Workforce\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nThere's been a ton of opportunity, a ton of talent unlocked. People's lifestyles are a lot better, so I'm very pro distributed workforce and remote. So I just want to give some tips here. So the first thing is always set up a expense management expense tracking system. A lot of times now they're embedded in credit cards. \n\nSo like Brex, Ramp, Expensify, Airbase. They all are really, really good, strong expense management tools. And they come with credit cards. So you can provision virtual credit cards to your employees. You can set low limits, so they don't abuse it or not that anyone would abuse it, but just you kind of limit the risk there. But getting those set up is really, really helpful to your accountant, to visibility in the organization, and making sure big expenses get approved and just keeping your accounting nice and easy. \n\nSo they are working for Remote's entity and then your company, your startup will have a deal with Remote where you're paying them money every month. And you're not only just paying like the salary and the benefit costs of that person, but you're also paying Remote a fee. That's how Remote makes money. So a lot of this is becoming more popular because there's sometimes there's like an emotional pull for people in other countries. They want to be \"an employee\". There's something emotional about it, beneficial. And so Remote is making this easy to do. And it's very, it's very cost-effective so definitely check out Remote.com. \n\nThe next thing is you really want to use a good accounting system. Now QuickBooks Online is our favorite and we've scaled that to even companies that are even doing over a hundred million dollars in revenue. We've got some tricks in our bag on the analytics portion of QuickBooks that make that possible, especially when kind of virtually consolidating a subsidiary. Eventually you will get to the point where you'll probably want to use something like NetSuite or Intacct for those foreign subsidiaries. If you're building out an actual foreign subsidiary in another country, if it's just people spread across the world, you actually won't really need to do that. But once you graduate and if you're, you know, hiring 10, 20 people in a given country, you're going to want to have a subsidiary. \n\nAnd you're going to want to consolidate that subsidiary and NetSuite becomes the choice there. But until then, which is usually, startups don't usually start doing that until they're like, you know, 60, 70, 100 people companies, you'll be using QuickBooks. And it's really, really powerful, easy to use and delivers good financials. If you are doing this in the United States, like your distributed workforce is across many, many states, the United States, like Kruze, you're really going to want to pay attention to state tax nexus. So tax nexus can be defined as having employees, people in a state, it can have property, assets. And the one that people kind of forget, it's relatively new is a certain threshold of sales or sales transactions. A lot of this was made possible by the, by the recent Wayfair decision by the Supreme court. \n\nOftentimes we have people who've been working, you know, they got, you know, God bless them. They're trying to take some shortcuts and not working with a real CPA firm or someone who's knowledgeable at startups to do their taxes. And they don't realize they're triggering 5471s and 5472s and they come to us and we have to give them the bad news that they owe $40,000 to the IRS. These can be appealed, but only appealed for the first year. So really stay on top of this, use a good CPA firm, do your taxes. I mean, this is what we do. This is what we specialize in. And we see like these unfortunate stories all the time. So just, just choose your CPA wisely. \n\nAnd then the final thing, I would really recommend having a strong budget slash financial model and doing budget to actuals, especially if your people are just completely distributed throughout the world, because you have kind of smaller windows to communicate directly with them, not everyone's on the same time zone, corporate culture, and the expense tracking is really important, but you also just need to have, you know, someone who can have expectations on what you're going to spend money on. How much you're going to spend money on, and have that kind of alarm bell in the budget to actuals every month to see if you overspent or underspent.",

So think of it as like senior preferred like the money that gets out first out of the preferred VC equity stack. And so the way this works is there's a lot of funds that are just dedicated to doing this or usually hedge funds that smell an opportunity. And there's a startup that's having trouble raising capital at like a clean, fresh valuation. Maybe because their previous round was at too high of a valuation given the market dynamics right now. So the NASDAQ's gone down a lot. The Bessemer Cloud Index has gone down a lot. \n\nThere's a lot of companies sitting around with like valuations that are just too high relative to where the market is now but those companies might still need money. And so the hedge funds, or kind of structured players, see an opportunity to come in, give the company money, have a senior security. Granted it's senior in terms of equity, but that's a pretty strong position still. And what they do is they have a very heavy like dividend or cash pay component. So they're getting effectively, it's like synthetic interest or getting interest out of the company to compensate them. And then also sometimes there is a paid in kind. Which means like equity component. So the equity position actually continues to increase. So instead of maybe all cash dividends it could be half cash dividends and half paid in kind dividends in the form of extra equity in that senior preferred. \n\nSo they're increasing their position as time goes which works well for them because it's compounding, right? It's actually like the total is getting bigger. Now the main feature and reason why a lot of startups not a lot, but some startups sign up for this is that it typically does not reset the valuation of the company. It's basically done at like the old valuation. It's just a different security. And this happens, this is attractive for numerous reasons. First of all, there's definitely like an ego component to this. Like being able to say you're a unicorn, a billion dollar valuation. It's very humbling and tough to to have to do a recap and bring that valuation down. \n\nAlso, when you do a recap there's usually a pay to play provision which means like the funds that still have reserves left. We've done a video on VC fund reserves, can, you know, basically pay and continue to play and protect their ownership. Whereas some funds, especially like the early, early stage investors are probably running funds that have very little capital in it now, when it's a late stage investment because they probably made the investment like eight years ago or seven years ago. So they can only reserve so much capital. \n\nAnd sometimes those early stage funds have a hard time protecting their ownership position in a down round or pay to play situation. So oftentimes on the capital structure, the management team really has no ability to write another check. Really like the management team is not, unless they're super wealthy and had some big exits before, is not going to have the capital fire power that a VC fund has no matter what. So you have this weird dichotomy where the management team through ego and also wanting to avoid pay to play or downward rounds, and also early stage investors sometimes do not want. They want to take the highly structured term sheet. \n\nThe later stage funds, they're fresher funds, they're usually like only a couple years old, and they could protect their own ownership position.",

      "description": "How is Accounting Debt - like Technical Debt.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nAccounting debt is you're moving so fast and maybe you're only focusing on technical aspects of your product or customers. You don't really think about your accounting infrastructure. And so, by just neglecting that, you're actually incurring accounting debt. It's a pretty interesting term. But the good news about accounting debt, I think it's actually even easier to avoid than technical debt. I'm just gonna give you a few steps here, so that you can avoid accounting debt. It'll save you a bunch of money, but more important for startup founders it's gonna save you a ton of time. Time is everything for startup founders. \n\nAnd so, if you follow these rules or guidance, you'll be able to avoid spending a ton of time on stuff you don't wanna do. So, the first thing you should do to avoid accounting debt is just get a corporate bank account. Our favorites are First Republic, SVB, Mercury, but getting a corporate account and putting money into that account, and then spending money only from that account, makes your accounting so much easier down the road. Now, if you don't have time to get a corporate account just get a corporate credit card. But you know, even that may be a little bit hard for you. So start documenting all the expenses, either through Expensify, or a spreadsheet. All the stuff you're putting on your personal credit cards, because you don't have time for that company credit card or company bank account, document it, we can go back later. It's super easy to fix later. If you don't document it. It takes us a lot of time. We're kind of comin' from a needle in haystack kinda stuff. \n\nSo that's a great example of accounting debt. So, there's a couple of other ways you can save time and money by avoiding accounting debt. So, the next one is just please set up a payroll system if you're gonna start paying employees. There is nothing worse than when we have a founder who has just written a check to an employee, without taking payroll taxes out and submitting those payroll taxes. This is probably my least favorite form of accounting debt. If you set up on Rippling, or Gusto, or Justworks, Sequoia, TriNet, any of those systems, it will be really easy to pay the person, and we will not have to go back and wade through a bunch of IRS payroll tax, angry letters and penalties. So accounting debt, please, please just pay your employees via a payroll system. \n\nThe next one is just do your taxes. And, you know, for companies that are just formed, sometimes that's as simple as just filing an extension and moving the deadline from April 15th to October 15th. But please do not neglect your taxes. And the other important thing about doing your taxes on time, and ideally, always filing an extension, is you can get that R&D tax credit, which is a rebate on your payroll taxes. There's nothing worse for us, it's kinda sad, when founders come back to us and they waited maybe a couple months before really engaging us. And in that meantime we found out that they used like an outsourced tax person or someone who's just not very good. And they filed the tax return without filing an extension and they didn't do the R&D tax credit. And oftentimes that's a 30 or $40,000 mistake. \n\nSo talk about accounting debt, like a missing out on 30 or $40,000 in payroll tax rebates, that's a really, really big deal. Now my final recommendation is just set up a really simple QuickBooks online account. And all you gotta do is just connect your bank accounts into the bank feed in QuickBooks. It'll probably take you five minutes max. But what that does is it starts bringing in the transactions into QuickBooks and a professional accountant once they're engaged, or hopefully you engage Kruze, we can go in there and automate a lot of the recognition, like the classification and labeling of the vendor, all that stuff. \n\nBut, if the transactions are already syncing, we don't have a lot problem, sometimes the banks only go back a certain number of months. So just getting that data flowing to QuickBooks can really be a big help. So I hope this helps. Accounting debt it's so similar to technical debt. And I think a lot of founders can really relate to this because they live technical debt every day in their life. But again, if you just take these four or five simple steps, you'll be able to avoid it.",

      "description": "Why VC backed Startups Don’t Usually do SBA Loans\n\nRaising venture debt? Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're talking about SBA loans and why startups typically don't do SBA loans. \n\nAnd SBA loans are mostly a traditional financing source for small businesses. So your mom and pops, your cashflow-positive businesses, maybe you're acquiring a small business, and you need to finance it with some debt, and so you use an SBA loan. SBA loans typically have a guaranteed portion for the lender by the US government, and have subsidized interest rates. So they're very friendly for cashflow-positive small businesses. But for venture capital-backed startups, those companies have a different risk-return profile for everyone involved. \n\nAnd typically, VC-backed companies can raise a lot of equity capital but the investors want big outcomes, and so those investors, and the founders, push the companies to grow fast, they're not really worried about being cashflow positive in the early years, for a long time really, and they have a high chance of actually just not working, and going out of business. And so if you're a founder of a VC-backed startup, you're already typically taking a way lower salary than you could if you were working in a big company, and to personally guarantee the loan, an SBA loan, on your company could be really, really dangerous. \n\nAgain, you're not running it to be cashflow positive or to pay back a loan, you're running it for a big outcome and running it to hopefully raise another round of venture capital in 18 to 24 months. And so it's one of those things where, be careful. I would hate for you to ruin, you're already taking a beating, probably personally and financially if your company doesn't make it as a founder, and to lose like your life savings or something like that because you personally guarantee the loan would just be a heart breaker. \n\nAnd so that's why we tell people not to do that. There are other sources of capital, debt capital for venture-backed startups. It's called venture debt, venture lending. We have a ton of information on it at the Kruze website. But basically, there are a bunch of lenders out there who love VC-backed companies, who not only underwrite the value and enterprise value of a company but they take into account the VC backers, and their willingness to write another check if things get tough, their willingness to help sell the company and park it and get the debt back if things don't go well. So there's definitely debt capital out there for you if you're a VC-backed startup. I just would not recommend doing an SBA loan. \n\nNow, SBA loans are a little more popular these days in the startup community because a lot of the PPP loans from COVID were actually structured as SBA loans and administered through the SBA Administration, but the traditional personally guaranteed SBA loan that's like a five-year amortizing loan, I would highly recommend you don't do that unless you're very, very sure you can be cashflow positive or are cashflow positive, and even that, I probably wouldn't do it. I'd only do that if I was a small business owner or buying a small business from someone else. So hope that helps. \n\nBe careful with those SBA loans, be careful with personal guarantees on your credit card, on other types of loans. It's really hard to get. You just can't out of those once you make that personal guarantee. Hope that helps, if you have any questions, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com. Thanks.",

      "description": "Which States are Taxing PPP Loan Forgiveness?\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nHey, Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm going over which states are taxing PPP loan forgiveness? \n\nSo PPP has actually been pretty big in the startup space, especially for a lot of seed and Series A companies that haven't raised a lot of capital. For the later stage companies, the venture capitalists encourage their companies not to take PPP loans and I think correctly those companies had another way of funding themselves, they had big institutional backers and really the PPP program wasn't really set up for them. But for the seed stage companies and Series A companies, especially that raised a lot of capital, they kinda function like small businesses, like realistically they're small businesses. \n\nAnd so a lot of those companies actually employ a lot of people. And so the PPP helped those companies stabilize when COVID hit and allowed them not to have to fire a bunch of employees which really helped stabilize our economy. So I was a pretty big fan of the PPP program. And now we have a lot of companies are actually doing forgiveness. So you took the PPP loan, you submit then submit through your bank portal, a PPP forgiveness application, you select the time period you're using either eight weeks or 24 weeks, you punch in all the right numbers, you run some reports, you provide all your bank statements, and the SBA and the banks are working together really, really well and they're actually forgiving a lot of these loans. \n\nAnd so a lot of the companies, this has been a great program for them, but there's one thing that's kind of, you don't wanna be ungrateful, but some of the states are actually taxing the PPP loan forgiveness. So the federal government who actually gave the money out is not taxing them. So if you did $100,000 PPP loan, you are not gonna have to pay federal taxes on that $100,000 but if you're in some of the big startup states are actually taxing them, so like California, Washington, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, those states are all taxing on a state level, the PPP forgiveness. \n\nNow there's an interesting thing happening here where a lot of startups are losing money, and so they're not typically paying taxes like most startups don't pay taxes. You still have to file a tax return, but you're not paying taxes. So, if you lost enough money to also cover the gain you would have had on a state basis on the PPP then you're still not gonna have to pay tax on that. So in my example, of like $100,000 forgiven, federally you don't pay taxes and then say your company lost $500,000 and you have this $100,000 PPP, well, you still on a state level have a $400,000 loss after you'd net those two out. \n\nSo you're gonna be okay and not have to pay taxes on that. But for companies that are profitable or operating right around breakeven, which a lot of companies do those are the ones that are gonna get hit by the state taxes. Now it's interesting, New York is actually not taxing PPP loans and Massachusetts is doing it kinda in a weird way where they're excluding it on a taxable basis for corporate taxes, but they are doing it on individual tax return income. \n\nSo it's a little more complicated, and again, it's intersecting with people's personal tax returns, I think that's on the S-corp LLC front. But just be aware, I want everyone to know that, especially talk to your tax provider, it's important that they're capturing this the correct way. \n\nI know the IRS is working overtime to get the revised tax forms out and while the software providers that do, that handle, help folks like us at Kruze with our in-house tax team actually do the taxes, are adjusting their systems to be able to handle this, but just if you're in a big startup state, that's not Massachusetts or New York, odds are you're gonna have to pay taxes or on that gain of forgiveness. \n\nSo hope that helps, thanks.",

I am the founder of Kruze Consulting. We help venture back startups with everything from accounting, finance, tax, and HR. One of the biggest questions that we get from our new founders is what systems they should set up. The answer is, number one, you should absolutely be on QuickBooks. Not Xero, not NetSuite, not FreshBooks. All great products, but, if you're looking for something that actually scales with you for when you're two employees all the way up to when you're 100, the answer is QuickBooks. The other three programs that you will absolutely need, and I like to call these the Holy Trinity, are Gusto for payroll, Expensify for expense reimbursement, and Bill.com for bill pay. There's a reason why you're gonna want to use explicitly those three programs, not any others, but just take my word for it. Gusto, Expensify, and Bill.com are your three choices. Thanks for watching!",

      "description": "Airbase and SVB offer a new integrated expense management solution\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nI think it's helpful to kind of re-trace where the industry's come from and then kind of put this new announcement into context. Before I get into that, just know, Kruze, we're one of the, probably the leading startup accounting tax firm, we have relationships with a bunch of companies I'm going to cover in this. Silicon Valley Bank, Airbase, Brex, Ramp, Bill.com. We are like, we believe in the best tools for everyone and so, we search out the best tools for all of our startups and that has led us to all of these vendors so just know we do business with all these vendors, we have conflicts, we recommend them, but I think you can trust this is coming from a really good place and we're excited about this announcement because it's actually going to open up the startup credit card/expense management market even more. \n\nSo, lets re-trace the history of the industry real fast. Silicon Valley Bank was the dominant bank in Silicon Valley tech startups. And they kind of, frankly, the credit card business for SVB was pretty big but I've kind of gone over this before. I think the bank got, was a little resting on it's laurels with not the greatest customer service, not the great technology and that really opened up the market for Brex to come in. \n\nAnd that was about four years ago. Brex came in with a better option for startups. They didn't have personal guarantees, way better technology integration, amped up the customer support. And that was a big deal and Brex has pretty high market share in credit cards. Now, the cool thing for SVB is they actually saw what was happening and had a very strong response. They actually came out with the SVB Innovator's Card which mirrored the best features of the Brex card so no personal guarantee, they really made the perks or, you know, your points, all that kind of stuff a lot better. \n\nFrom our end as accountants they made the interface and integrations with Quickbooks and other tools so much better and they finally made customer support much better. So SVB responded, started to retake the market share. Then came along Ramp and Divvy. Who are both card-centric but expense management tools as well and in the last like, kind of year we've seen Ramp do a major push into this market and is getting a lot of market share. And, Bill.com acquired Divvy, so we had typically referred Bill.com as a bill pay solution. It was actually, Bill.com came around, what, nine, ten years ago, I think it's a $26 billion valuation company now public. Check my podcast, I interviewed Renee, like five years ago, the founder and CEO and they acquired Divvy because they saw where this market was going. \n\nThe market is really going to an integrated approach. Cards plus expense management. And for those who don't know, you know, people think of cards as the dumb kind of Chase, Amex card that you might have or legacy had. But really, Brex, SVB's Innovator Card, Ramp, Airbase's capabilities, Divvy. They all let you do a lot more dynamic provisioning, dynamic changing of limits. It's just so much easier for everybody, it's better integration into Quickbooks which makes your accountant happy because it makes us more efficient. So this has been a really big leap in the category in the last two or three years. And one of the coolest things about the Airbase/SVB partnership is SVB had one of the leading cards but didn't quite have just as much integration as many of those tools I just noted as some of the other players. \n\nBut now, by integrating into Airbase they get best in class expense management tools. It's really, really big, and again, it may not seem like a big thing but if you can automatically provision or just decide to provision virtually a credit card for employee, you tend to use expense management software, like build Expesify expense reports much less. The employees have a much greater sense of freedom. They can actually make purchases with a very simple approval flow or they have a lower limit, you know they're not going to abuse it and so they can just make that purchase without having to bug someone and waste someone else's time. \n\nSo, if you're a startup your life just got a little bit easier. And if you're an accountant your life got a lot easier with this partnership and integration between Airbase and SVB, so congrats to the firms, I think there'll be a lot more going on in this market as we go forward and I'll keep doing videos to explain all the changes that happen but congrats, congrats to the players, congrats to all the startups out there and congrats to us, your friendly CPA, who just saved a lot of time because of that integration. Thanks.",

      "description": "How Do I Get in Touch with Angel or Seed Funds\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\n1- First, you know, it's helpful to just think through, like most angels are high net worth individuals, like they've made money somewhere. They've had some success, and that's why they're investing in startups. Seed funds are typically like actual institutional venture capital funds, professional money managers, who look at startups all day long. \n\nSo it's always best to go through those channels if you can, and really when you're looking to get in touch with angels and seed funds, getting introductions is really, really helpful. It really kinda cuts through the red tape. The mental overhead of whether the investor wants to meet with you or not, it's easier for them to decide. So, I would go with intros and through people you know, if possible. Now, there's a lot of people, especially outside like the Bay Area and New York and maybe Santa Monica, who are creating really cool startups these days, but don't have that direct connection to, you know, the sexy angel investors or the seed funds, and so this is where networking or cold emailing can really help you out. \n\nAnd sometimes, you know, investors, you'll see them joking that they don't answer cold emails, but they do. There's a lot of investors who will actually answer cold emails, so if you can't get that intro, don't give up. So what should your cold email say? First of all, it's got to be upbeat. It's gotta be really tight, and you don't wanna send 'em like \"War and Peace,\" like a whole volume of text. You wanna keep it short and to the point. The first couple sentences, they really should be a short explanation of what the company's doing and why it's important and the potential. So maybe like three sentences, and I'm not joking here about keeping it short. Investors tend to have a short attention span. You're a guest in their email box. You wanna keep it short and powerful. The next thing you wanna do is express the traction and progress you've made. \n\nNow this could be building a product and getting it into the app store, or getting it on the web, or getting people to use it, maybe it's revenue traction, maybe you're Ramen profitable, and you're actually breaking even already, but some type of signal that people like what you're doing, that you have some traction, and they should take it seriously. Now, another thing I like to include is some type of link, or a presentation, or a one pager attached to the email that way, when they wanna learn more, they can click that and quickly skim through it. Investors look at tons of presentations and one pagers, they're very, very good at doing that efficiently, so absolutely include that. Another thing you wanna include is just the dollar ask and the dollar size of the round. Very simple, we're raising $2,000,000, and I'd love it if you'd be interested in putting in $100,000, or I'd love it if you'd be interested in leading the round. \n\nSome type of signal, so they know how much you're looking for, and maybe you can also include how much is already committed, and so they're just kinda feeling, like you're raising 2,000,000, but 1.5's already committed. You're hoping they can fill in the rest of that round. So those are the really, really important things. You also wanna personalize it for them, make it, you know, in some way, whether it's a distant connection, or you saw them write a great article, or you just know they ran a business that was kinda the first generation of what you're building, some personalization and saying why it's important for you to get them to invest. You want their expertise is another thing I'd always include. So again, you know, to wrap it up, it's always better to get an intro, especially if you just know an angel or seed fund or some of your colleagues or friends do, but if you have to, you can use the cold email format that I just gave you. \n\nAnd, you know, as I'm recording this, another thing just popped in my head, which is lawyers and accountants like Kruze can be an excellent conduit to angels and seed funds. Like we work with 'em all day long, we know who the good ones are. We know who might be interested in your market or what you're building, and so also look to your lawyer and accountant for intros. They're not gonna like get your company funded for you, but they can make a few intros to help you out. So, I hope that helps. Good luck, happy hunting on the investor front, and looking forward to seeing what you're building. If you have questions, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com.",

      "description": "How Startups are Financed\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nStartups are kind of unique to like your traditional small business in that, they tend to be technology-based whether it's like biotech, or medtech, or software, or hardware. And that technology base tends to require some capital investment. And so, this video is for eventually venture backed startups. It's very possible to be a bootstrap company in the technology world. I mean Kruze is a bootstrap company in the technology world. So we're doing it. But a lot of companies will end up raising capital instead of bootstrapping their selves. \n\nUsually the first stage is some combination of bootstrapping and or friends and family rounds. And so this is when you're first getting the idea working and it may just be you doing the startup. Maybe you have a co-founder maybe there's a couple people on the team. But at that stage if you can find a paying customer or a couple of paying customers, you can bootstrap it for a little while. And basically bootstrapping just means like you're taking the money that your customers give you. And you're living off that. That's what funds payroll. You're probably not taking much payroll. I mean, I remember in the early days of Kruze Consulting Vanessa and I were getting paid $25,000 a year, for a couple of years, that was extremely painful. Bootstrapping is very, very hard. So the natural next step to bootstrapping is to do a friends and family round. \n\nAnd friends and family are really investing in you because they support you. They love you. They care about you. They think what you're doing is probably cool but they're not like expert investors. So I always like to remind founders to, try to give them a good deal. Sometimes founders get caught up in dilution and thinking that like, they've got to maximize everything. \n\nAngel investors are typically people who've done very well in their career maybe professional angel investors at this point AngelList has made doing angel funds, seed funds, really, really easy. And so they're more professional. They're really good at underwriting the potential of the market, the potential of the company, where this could go, maybe competitors. And so they are typically willing to pay up a little bit more than friends and family. \n\nAnd one thing that's really important to think about as soon as you take friends and family money and angel money you're basically signing up for, to go long, to do like the whole startup journey. No one really wants to invest in a friends and family or an angel round, to have the company get sold for like $5 million or $10 million. All of those investors, especially like the professional angels are looking at you and saying like, okay, 12 months from now, after you build something of value with the capital I'm giving you. \n\nSo pre-seed and seed is the next step. And those are typically anywhere from 10 to $50 million institutional funds.  \n\nAs soon as they cross that $20 million fund amount they start participating at something like 20 to 30% of the profits.\n\nA pre-seed might be $500K to a million dollars whatever it is typically the lead investor of that seed or pre-seed fund will sign up for half to two-thirds maybe three quarters of that amount. \n\nThe series A funds are really helping. The bar is really high. Like you need to have locked in financials. You need to have, a locked in roadmap for product development. You have to have clear expectations of when you're gonna get customers and they will hold you accountable. You'll typically raise, 18 months of cash, maybe 24 months. \n\nSeries B investors typically follow very quickly the series A investors. I always joke that series A investors have, the speed dial. Like if you have Vinod Khosla on your board he's got five series B investors who are dying to invest in all of his companies. And so they can make raising that next round a lot easier by using their network.  \n\nAnd series C is really kind of a make or break it moment for most startups. You've got some traction because you wouldn't have been able to get a series B without it but now you need to really be scaling and building something super exciting to attract capital. Series C investors, they're investing in preferred, too, are going to be super financially oriented. They're gonna start thinking about time to exit, IPO. \n\nFinally series D, series F, these are super financially driven investors. They're gonna look at your customer acquisition cost, your LTV, and say if I give this company a dollar they're gonna turn it into five. This is the kind of company I wanna invest in. And I think I can do an IPO in a year or two years, or maybe there's a buyout in a year or two years.",

My first, and this kinda dates back to when we had an actual physical office with a very large boardroom table in our office, and then we had seats around the boardroom table. And so, we used to make a very strong attempt to encourage junior people, and especially women and minority folks, to sit at the table. There's something very symbolic about sitting at the table, getting comfortable there, and having your voice heard. And when people see you sitting at the boardroom table, they know that your voice is important, and so that's one way to mitigate playing favorites, to rotate that, to get everyone comfortable sitting at the table. \n\nThe third item that a lot of employees complained about their employer about was that there was no clear development plan for their career. And so, this is something that we've taken a lot of effort and invested a lot of time into at Kruze, and so one of the ways we do a development plan is that every written review cycle has a section for the development plan, and the near-term goals and long-term goals for our employees. So, it's very important to write this out, because everyone can come back and reference it. Sometimes when you just do this verbally, and I've made this mistake myself, people kinda forget, it's not concrete, they don't know exactly what they need to do, so written improvement plans are very, very helpful. Also, a career progression presentation is very, very helpful. One of the things we do is we actually list out the different goals and skills you need to have to progress to certain positions in our company, this is really helpful. \n\nIt's a lot of work, it takes a lot of energy from the folks that are running the company, but there's so much more productivity, people enjoy working at your company so much more, and they just improve and become more powerful so much faster, it's really worth the investment. I hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "For a seed round, are many investors or a small group better?\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nMy professional opinion is it depends. It's actually really the founder's choice. There's positives and negatives with both. So let's kind of roll through it. So first of all, the bottom line when you're doing a startup and you're backed by investors is, you've got to raise the money somehow, someway. So this question is more for people who have the choice really. If you don't have the choice, do not worry, there's so many legendary stories. I think Jeff Bezos had to meet with 100 venture capitalists before he got the first check for Amazon. Like stuff like that happens all the time. It is not really correlated to the success of your company. \n\nSo don't get discouraged. If you're in the position where you've just got to raise money somehow, someway, then do both. Raise it from as many small people, and as many big people who will give you money. Now, if you do have the choice, there's a couple things that you're going to want to kind of factor in. First of all, it is easier to manage usually fewer investors. And so people kind of refer to that as your cap table, your ownership table. \n\nAnd so having a couple big ones is actually pretty nice. And once you get them over the hump and they're committed in investing in the company, then it's a lot easier. Your work's kind of done. The only negatives with that are you are really beholden to that person. The people who invested, the few people who invest in their company, especially if they're funds, they've got a lot of control. What they think really matters. There's going to be a lot of oversight. \n\nWhen you go to raise your next round of funding, a lot of people are going to actually ask about it. Ask that investor who previously invested what they think. So you've got to really keep that person happy. You need to do good reporting. You need to respect what they think about the business and take their advice. But they will write you a big check. You can get the fundraising over quickly, and especially if they're a well-regarded fund, you can often use the term sheet they sign to fill in behind them with a lot of individual investors. \n\nAnd so the mechanism for that is like, this happens with seed a lot, where a seed fund will say hey, I'm going to take $1.5 million of a $3 million seed round, which means there's another $1.5 million available to be invested but the founders' got to fill that up. And so the founders can go around to the angel networks or maybe like another seed fund that people like and say, \"Hey, X, Y and Z Ventures is already committed, and they've already done the diligence and here's the term sheet they signed. Would you like to participate and piggy back on all the diligence, and really kind of buy into the opinion they have that this is going to be a big company?\" And it's really effective, especially at seed stage. Seed stage, there's not a lot of traction to judge whether the company's going to be successful or not. \n\nA lot of it is how good is the idea, what's the vibe from the entrepreneurs? Do they have a track record of making companies successful? And so getting that stamp of approval from a bigger fund who's going to take a big portion of the investment round is really, really helpful. So that's the argument for taking money from at least a couple big investors and using them to kind of help fill out the round. If you want to go full on lots of little investors, I've seen a lot of companies do this very, very successfully at the early stage and really, they're going to friends and family, they're going to people they went to business school with or people they worked with at a prior company. And you can get a lot of 25, 50, 100K checks, depending on how successful the people in your network are. And fill up a round very quickly, and those people will often be true believers and will actually, you have kind of like the crowdfunding effect where they will spread the word and tell other people about your business. And so you get a little bit of a marketing pop out of this, which is great. \n\nNow, you can get a marketing pop from the couple big investors because the funds that do these investments have usually a PR team, they'll help you get press for it, they have a brand name, but the kind of quote, unquote crowdfunding approach of a lot of little investors can be just as powerful. There's a lot of voices out there talking about your company and promoting it. And especially if they're users of what you're doing because hey, those people have put their money where their mouth is. And they believe.",

And today I'm answering the question, \"How do I handle petty cash in my startup?\" \n\nAnd for those who don't know, petty cash is basically a term for cash kind of lying around that is used for very small purchases. So for example, maybe pay for parking, tip a parking valet or a restaurant, something like that. And my basic advice is actually, try not to do petty cash or use petty cash at your startup. The amazing thing in the age we live in right now is that there's so many credit card options, and it's very easy to just create virtual credit cards or credit cards with dynamic limits for employees. In the old days, petty cash was used a lot more often. But nowadays, everyone on your team, including you, the founder, can have a credit card. And the reason why I'm so against petty cash is it's kind of like an accounting weakness for a couple reasons. A) people tend to not get receipts for that kinda of stuff and $300 just kind of disappears every month or something like that, right? \n\nAnd when you add that up, it's not a huge material amount of money, but it's just not doing things the right way. And there could be like a serial abuser, someone on the team who just decides to, they dip in and take a hundred bucks every month or something like that. So that's an accounting weakness. The IRS requires you to have receipts for anything over $75, so you just don't want that little accounting weakness. Secondly, it can send a really bad message to the team that cash is fungible, the company's money is fungible. It's our money, not the company's money. And you got to remember as a founder, you're a fiduciary. \n\nSo you are responsible at a higher level than you might realize with what happens with the company's money. And we've seen times over the years where all of a sudden an office manager is paying their own credit card with the company's money. Or the founder's staying in lavish hotels and buying a lot of clothing or other kind of things. And petty cash is one of those things that can start you down that slippery slope. It's almost like a gateway drug to poor financial controls and usage. And so again, in this day and age, you can just use a credit card, give everyone a virtual one or get everyone a regular credit card, have a dynamic limit, low limits for employees. And it's also easy for your accountant to review that and see what those credit card charges are being paid for. That will protect you. \n\nAnd again, it just kind of instills a greater level of responsibility, process, controls in the company. So not a fan of petty cash. I've seen a few founders over the years abuse it. Don't go there, stay away. Use virtual credit cards. It's so much easier for everybody. I hope that helps.

      "description": "Can your Startup Change its Accounting Method for PPP 2 Loan eligibility?\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today I'm answering the question, can my startup change its accounting treatment to be eligible for PPP2 loans? \n\nAnd the background on this is when PPP2 came out, there's a clause there that says if you're a startup, if your company had a 25% reduction in gross receipts, AKA revenue, in any quarter in 2020 versus 2019, then you would be eligible for a second PPP loan. And so basically, say you had a great year in 2019 but then COVID really hurt your company in 2020 and one of your quarters you were down more than 25%, then hey, you get a second bite of the apple. \n\nThere's another PPP loan that you can get, which is a pretty substantial amount of money. It's about 2.5 times your average monthly salaries in 2020. So there's a lot of money at stake here and so I've had a couple of founders ask me this question of like hey, we're on accrual method, which is how startups should be, what the accounting method, meaning you basically, all your revenue and costs are booked when incurred, or excuse me, when the services are provided or when the expenses are actually incurred versus cash accounting when you actually pay for those things or collect the revenue. Startups should be on accrual, that's GAAP based, that's what VCs want, that's what M&A acquirers want. It also just makes running your business a lot easier 'cause you're actually gonna see what's going on all the time. \n\nBut a few folks have been like, hey, why don't we change our accounting treatment to cash and then it will show a more than 25% reduction. We'll be eligible for PPP2, a second bite of the apple. And so you really don't wanna mess around with this. The IRS actually has, the IRS and SBA I believe, SBA's administering all the PPP loans, have guidance out saying explicitly to not do this. Do not pick and choose or flip around for purposes of getting a second bite of the apple, a second PPP loan. It's unethical and it's against the regulations or against their guidance. So if you do that, you are setting yourself up for a very painful audit and potentially some embarrassing press. So please, don't do that. \n\nI know none of the Kruze clients will do that because we'll help educate them if they were even leaning towards doing that. But if you're working with another accounting firm and maybe they are not on the up and up or whatever it is, just don't do it. Don't take that chance. You're expressly violating what the IRS and SBA have prescribed on this. Don't around mess with your revenue recognition or flipping to cash accounting if you're just trying to stretch and get this loan. \n\nI know it's a lot of money, I know it's tempting probably but it's not best practice and you don't wanna run afoul of the IRS and SBA. So hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "Why do Big Acquirers like to buy Small Startups via Asset Sale instead of an Equity Purchase?\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today I'm answering the question why do big companies like to buy smaller startups in an asset sale versus an equity purchase? \n\nAnd it's really pretty simple actually. The big companies are always super nervous about buying a company in an equity purchase meaning they bought all the equity and complete ownership of the company and unintentionally assuming a bunch of liabilities they don't know about. And so the classic examples of this are maybe there is a lease that was never disclosed to the acquirer and the acquirer's on the hook for a couple hundred thousand dollars a year for another five years. Or there's a huge sexual harassment suit that's brewing or is being filed that wasn't disclosed. Or, this doesn't happen in startups very often but like toxic waste on the startup premises. You know, things like this, these are all very, very expensive issues and the big company is really just trying to buy the startup for their technology and for their team and for their brand and the customer relationships. \n\nAnd they don't want any of these unintended liabilities that can really come back and bite them in the butt later. And so the big companies doing the right thing for them by buying the company in an asset sale. Because an asset sale you're just buying the assets, you're not assuming all the liabilities of a company. And that's why it's typically structured like this. Now a lot of startups say like, \"Hey, how much leverage do I have or can I push this to an equity sale?\" And the reality in an acquisition is you only have so much leverage. \n\nSo if this company really wants to buy you and it's reflected in the purchase price, then yes, you can push for an equity sale. But if it's a 10 million, 5 million, $20 million purchase it's kind of signaling that you don't have a ton of leverage or else the purchase price will be higher, right? And so oftentimes you don't have enough leverage to push it into an equity sale instead of an asset sale. But that's not such a bad thing, like, I don't think it's that big of a deal for founders. You're gonna basically just have this entity that you started, corporate entity, that's gonna keep living and you'll probably keep it living until all the earn-out payments are actually made and then you'll shut it down and do all the distributions. \n\nBut practically speaking it's not really gonna impact your tax basis or anything like that, so it's not that big a deal. I always recommend to founders that oftentimes when you're negotiating you can only pick a couple things you really want to negotiate. And so I always recommend to founders like, Hey, focus on the purchase price that's what really matters. The asset versus equity purchase isn't gonna really change your life that much but getting another $5 million or another $10 million of purchase price, that can help change your life. \n\nSo focus on that and again, this is why asset sales are done with big companies and small companies. As the two, in a merger of equals or a really big acquisition maybe a 100, $200 million, $500 million acquisition, they're gonna do typically an equity purchase. Because there's just a lot of like other stuff that is beneficial for them, but for the little ones for the little acquisitions, they're gonna wanna stick to an asset purchase. Hope that helps, thanks.",

Get the finance and accounting due diligence checklist: https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-capital-finance-tax-hr-due-diligence-checklist\n\nA lot of VC firms, especially the new ones, are always out pounding the pavement, taking meetings, pitching their fund. Very, very similar to an entrepreneur's life who's raising money. I thought I'd just kinda go through where the VCs get their capital. So, the first one is endowments, and it's one of the biggest ones. And so, this is typically the big private universities, although public university systems, like the University of California system, have a big endowment, as well. They are a major player, so Yale, Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Northwestern, those are some of the biggest endowments out there. \n\nAgain, the University of California system is very large, as well. And in the same way that entrepreneurs are hoping to get the top VC on their board, well, guess what, funds are trying to get the top endowments on their board and to lead a fund. \n\nThe next one is also huge, which is pension funds. Pension funds go anywhere from California teacher's pension to the big state pension funds. UTIMCO is one, the Texas pension fund is a really, really big one that's active in venture capital. And then, all the way down to local pension funds, like local police and fire departments. They actually have pension funds. They utilize consultants, so there's a whole industry out there of consulting firms that benchmark, track, and evaluate venture capital funds against each other and make recommendations, especially to the pension funds 'cause a lot of times, especially the local ones, they don't have enough money under management and the funds to hire a bunch of full time people who are evaluating all the VC funds. And also, that's kind of a full time job. It's one of those things where everyone benefits from a research group that can canvass the whole industry. \n\nAnd it's a similar asset allocation to the pension funds and endowments, but again, there's very, very large foundations that you can go and call on and raise money for a VC. And again, family offices, some people would say this is a different subset, some say this kinda mirrors or is a portion of the foundations, but family offices are generally very, very wealthy people, but it might be, wealthy is all in the eye of the beholder, it might be someone who has $100 million family office or a 200, $500 million family office. They're gonna make a lot smaller venture capital direct checks than someone who has a foundation that's $10 billion or $20 billion. Again, in the same way that the pension funds have different sizes, the same thing is happening in the family office and foundation world. And then the final group, the fifth group, would be high net worth individuals. These are people who've made some money, they're professionals. \n\nTypically, a lot of high net worth people that invest in venture capital funds are people in the tech industries who've made some money and oftentimes, entrepreneurs who've been backed by the very fund they're investing in. That was one of our things at Lighthouse. We had a lot of entrepreneurs who we had actually worked with who wanted to invest in our fund because they knew the value prop, they knew we knew what we were doing, and they had taken that dilutive capital from the venture capitalists, and so, they wanted to get on the other side of that and benefit from that. High net worth is typically, when you're starting out a new fund, that's usually where you first start. You're raising money from high net worth people, 50K, 100K, $250,000 at a time, maybe even $1 million, and then you slowly crawl up into the foundations, endowments, pension funds, and family offices. Those are the big four. But a lot of venture capital funds start out with high net worth individuals. \n\nAgain, the reason why folks like to move upstream into the bigger checks, into the foundations, endowments, and pension funds, is because of the bigger checks and because of that brand, because of that reputation, and because of that kind of quiet, implicit promise that they'll invest in multiple funds. I hope this helps. It's really helpful to know, actually, where your venture capitalists get their money. The pressures they have, the need for them to perform when they are sweating you in the board meeting, hey, it's because they need your company to work out so they can return an exit or a good amount of capital to their investors and they can raise another fund. \n\nWe're all in business here. Hope that helps, thanks, bye.",

      "description": "Accounting for startup financing from Pipe\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today we're answering the question how do you account for a loan from Pipe? \n\nAnd for those that don't know, Pipe.com is a new lending marketplace that allows companies with reoccurring revenue streams to actually, basically, generate cash or capital upfront by factoring or trading their future payment stream. But the interesting thing about this is factoring invoices has been around forever. That's what banks do really, really well. You have a customer, you provide a service for them, you invoice them, you're going to get your cash in 30 days, but instead, the bank will actually give you 96 cents on the dollar and then collect the money from the customer directly. That is factoring receivables. \n\nWhat's cool about Pipe is you don't even have to have a receivable. You are factoring payment streams that you probably haven't even invoiced yet way out in the future. But the investors who are on the Pipe platform who are basically buying these future payment streams don't require a pure invoice like the bank would. So super interesting financing innovation. Really, really good for reoccurring revenue businesses like SaaS companies. It's really nice. It's a great innovation, we're super excited about them, we're sending clients over to Pipe. \n\nAnd one of the things I like about the marketplace side of this with the investors who are buying the payment streams is they compete. You are actually going to get a better cost of capital than if you just go out to one or two investors and take whatever they give you. The investors are competing on the other side of the marketplace, which means your cost of capital or effective interest rate is actually being driven down by the marketplace, by competition. So super duper exciting there. Now how to treat this on an accounting basis. \n\nWell, the first part of it, you get a deposit from Pipe and that is going to debit your cash, meaning your cash is going to go up and you're also going to credit a short-term liability. It's kind of like short-term debt, right? You have a liability to the investor who bought your payment stream and you're going to pay them on a monthly basis. Now, the payments that go out are going to go against that short-term liability. So you're going to credit cash, meaning cash is going to go down for that payment amount every month and you're going to debit the short-term liability accounts on the liability side of the balance sheet. So hopefully for all you accountants out there, you're understanding this. But basically with every monthly payment, cash goes down and short-term liability account, the debt you owe, is going to go down, too. \n\nNow, there's a little twist here in that a portion of that monthly payment you're making is actually embedded interest because the investors bought it at a discount, so there's an effective interest component up to this. And so Pipe actually has thought of this and they have a really nice little report inside their marketplace that shows you the discount or component of interest. And so your accountant can split that payment amount up and book a portion of it as interest and the rest of it as the short-term liability, which means your debt balance is actually going to decrease. So there's lot going on here, but basically it's important to recognize that there is an interest component, an embedded interest component that you're paying when you use Pipe to bring cash forward and sell off your future payment stream. So I hope that helps. It's a really great tool. \n\nWe're seeing people use it and hopefully we'll have more content on Pipe coming up.

      "description": "Who is the highest paid person at a startup?\n\nLooking for advice setting up your startup’s HR, finance, and payroll infrastructure? Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health\n\nMost people would think the founder or CEO, but she is usually not the highest paid person at the startup. It is usually, drum roll, one of two people, the VP of sales or the CTO. And when you kind of think about it, there's actually some good reasons for that. First of all, salespeople are notoriously and beneficially motivated by money in those ways, it's a little bit more, it's not that they're greedy people. It's more of a, I think psychologically like a score-keeping thing for salespeople. They really love achievement, they really love closing deals, they like to keep score through that, and so oftentimes VP of sales are the highest paid people at a startup because they bring in the money, eventually. \n\nBut they are not heavy base salary people. In fact, they usually have some of the lowest base salaries in the whole company. And the reason for that is the company's incentive structure wants them to be very, very focused on bringing in new sales and not just kind of showing up to work and putting their feet on the desk. \n\nBut I always remind them that the sales team and the VP of sales are directly aligned with the sales goals of the company, with where the company needs to go, so it's an investment and it's well worth it. The second person who might be the highest paid person at a startup would be the CTO, founding engineer, VP of engineering, someone who is very irreplaceable on the technology side and because we're working with startups so maybe at like a mom and pop small business or something not in the tech or biotech, med tech world, this could be different, like a service company, but for a technology startup, the CTO is just one of the most important people in the company. It's also really hard to find a good CTO/VP of engineering/founding engineer. \n\nBut they're going to own, she's going to own 20 to 50% of the company. If there's two co-founders, obviously, it's probably going to be more like the 40% kind of zone, something like that. But the founders are going to have tremendous upside, but that's usually the bargain they make. They want that upside. They're willing to forgo the big salaries. Oftentimes founders could be working at Netflix, Google, Facebook, wherever, making huge salaries, but they've chosen the path of building their dream and try and change the world and getting that big equity upside. \n\nAnd the other thing, I just kind of put a quick plug in here for equal pay for, across genders, across races. We've done a lot of studies on women founders, women CEO pay, and how when COVID hit, it was interesting, women CEOs actually reduced their salaries dramatically relative to male CEOs. And we're not exactly sure why. We're not sure if it's, maybe some of those companies, just the CEOs were more tied into their companies emotionally and just really wanted to make sure the company would survive or maybe they hadn't raised as much money or maybe they're just more conscientious people. I don't know. \n\nA lot of the women in my life are more conscientious than me, so I think that's a very, very high possibility. But for whatever reason, we saw some real bifurcations in pay for CEOs, startups, across gender. And unfortunately we don't have enough data on pay across races or ethnicities, but that's something that we should all pay attention to. So if you're a venture capitalist and watching this video, do a pay study. You can get the data from your portfolio companies. Really, really easy. Benchmark where people are and if people are underpaid and they just happen to be not a white male and happen to be a woman or a different ethnicity, then get them up to average, at least, if not more. \n\nBut I think only a little bit of diligence, a little bit of work on this will translate to equal pay across genders and ethnicities and I really encourage the venture capital community to take this on, do the work. You have the data or contact your friendly CPA firm, Kruze Consulting, and we'll get it for you. But let's make that change there and make the world a little bit better place for all the folks who are starting companies, no matter what their race and gender are. And just remember, bringing it all the way around, it's okay to pay your VP of sales a lot of money. It's okay to pay your sales team a lot of money. \n\nIt's okay to pay your engineering team a lot of money. Those people have very specific skillsets, they are critical to your startup's success, and I know it may kind of tweak you a little bit or bother you a little bit on the inside, but it's an investment and it's an investment well-made. So hope that helps. Hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com if you have any questions or comments. We're here to help you, thanks.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today, we're talking about what the Plaid acquisition by Visa means for startup bookkeepers. And at Kruze, we've been using Plaid for a while and we love it. One of the best things about it is it gives us really clean data from the banks. Sometimes when bank feeds come into Quickbooks, it's a little messy and it's hard to automate the generation of statements. Well, guess what? Plaid does all of that for us. Now, we still use the bank feed and Quickbooks because it's super important that all the transactions and Quickbooks are matched to bank transactions. That's called like a true reconciliation. You don't want anything, not match the cash.\nBut being able to automate the generation of statements is a huge time saver for us, and we can even do it mid-month. instead of waiting till the first of every month to get the statement. That allows us to do a cash reconciliation mid-month and limit the work towards the end of the month. That means our clients get their financials a lot faster. This is huge for the startup clients that are monitoring burn, need to give their V.C.'s the report on what the burn rate and the revenue was for the month before. So Plaid's been huge for Kruze Consulting, and with the acquisition of Visa, I think it's gonna get better. Visa's gonna be able to dedicate a lot more resources to Plaid. For instance, right now we can't get check images from Plaid. They know about it. We know about it. We ask them about it every month. That's the kind of thing that Visa will be able to spend money on and give us the actual check images so we know who the checks are written out to. So we can account for it properly instead of having to log into the pesky bank account. So plaid, I think is going to go to the moon here. It's a huge acquisition. It's a great acquisition by Visa and it's really going to help all the startup bookkeepers out there in the ecosystem. Thanks.",

      "description": "Tough Times are a Good Reminder to Pick your VC’s Thoughtfully\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $10 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about how tough times are a good reminder to pick your venture capitalists carefully. \n\nAnd I think especially over the last year, it's been just a ferocious capital market. Startups have been getting term sheets thrown at them. They've been getting preempted, valuations have gone crazy in a good way for a lot of founders. And now, I'm recording this in late May 2022, like the market's changing. The stock market's down, private valuations are coming down, market's getting a lot tougher. So a lot of people are looking back and saying like, \"Hey, maybe I should have been a little more thoughtful in those decisions I made\". And we all can do that in life, but what's happening is sometimes working through your existing investors and getting them to make a second commitment can be really, really tough. \n\nAnd, you know, there's been times in the past, where some people have been taking money from like hedge funds or nontraditional VCs, and it's really difficult to know how they act in tough times. So everyone's kind of finding out. Also those folks, the hedge funds and institutional investors that normally don't play in venture, are also finding out a lot about the founders they back. So it's a two-way street for sure. But I'm definitely seeing people, you know, realizing that they have to go back, they need more money, they're wondering what kind of terms they're going to get. And so you start seeing things. I haven't really seen too much of this yet, but this is probably what's on the horizon for some of the companies, which are, you know, the venture capitalist feeling like, \"Hey, that last valuation was really high. You drove that up on me. You really drove it hard. Now is my chance to recapture some of the economics.\" \n\nAnd you see them do that through a couple things: either a down round on the next term sheet that they're offering you, or they'll start inserting you know, multiples on liquidation preferences, meaning they get their capital back, plus like a multiplier on that. Also participating preferred, which I have not seen yet, but does tend to happen in these cycles, which means basically they get their liquidation preference back and then they participate on the upside, as if they had just converted. So it's kind of like a double dip, even some of the, you know, voting as a share class, like blocking a merger, doing other kinds of operational things can start to happen. \n\nSo I'm recording this video as a little bit of like a you know, keep your head up and make sure you're paying attention, so that these kind of things don't happen to you. Make sure you don't run so low on cash these are your only options. But it's also kind of a good reminder to everyone in the ecosystem that reputation matters. And rather than letting a valuation lead you into like a one week diligence period in signing documents, you really want to get to know your venture capitalist. It's a very, very long term relationship. It's pretty much impossible to get someone off the cap table once they're on it. \n\nAnd so take your time, pick your VCs according to the values you have. Maybe you just care about valuation, which is totally defensible. I tend to, I've worked in this, doing this, a very long time. I tend to really value relationships and people who step up when things are aren't going great. Because it's easy to be a cheerleader and a big fan when things are going really, really well. \n\nBut you need your investors, your venture capitalists often to write a check in tough times or go to bat with you with an outside lead and help protect the valuation. So just remember, you know, pick your venture capitalist carefully. You want someone who's a long-term partner and who'll help you build the company. Hope that helps. \n\nIf you have other questions on VC, or how to raise capital, or startup funding options, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com and please subscribe to the YouTube channel.

      "description": "The IRS Opens Up Electronic Submission for Power of Attorney\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're talking about a new IRS innovation. \n\nThey are allowing electronic signatures and electronic power of attorney requests. This is really, really nice. They've like, getting power of attorney for a client is not the most fun thing for a tax firm like Kruze, but you got to do it if you're going to talk to the IRS about a given company's tax returns and tax history. And so there's actually a couple different forms people fill out on paper right now, 2848s or 8821s. And so typically, you know, if we have like an issue, like maybe someone missed their 5471 filing, like their foreign corporation statement, like, you know, they have a foreign subsidiary and we have to call the IRS to try to get them abated on that, like, we need a power of attorney signature. \n\nAnd so it involves like getting it signed and then mailing it in through snail mail to, you know, Kansas City or Utah. Those are typically where the IRS's, you know, West Coast people have to send their stuff to either Kansas City or Utah. But now, the IRS just came out this last week, you can actually do it through their online portal. And it's called a Tax Pro account. So it's a little bit new and maybe not the most creative name, but this is really, really nice. It's going to make it so much easier for, you know, to do a startup's, you know, to advocate for a startup on tax relief or get records, when missing records. Like sometimes founders, before they come to Kruze, use the not so great tax firm, and they don't even have a copy of their tax return, which is like, you know, it's kind of hard to believe, but that does happen. \n\nAnd so being able to get a copy of the EIN letter or past tax returns, or just advocating on behalf of the startup is actually really helpful. And so thank you IRS, for innovation here and while I'm on it, like, you know, I really recommend people be super nice to the folks at the IRS. They're under a lot of stress. If anyone has been following this during COVID, a lot of the offices were shut down. And so there's just like so much extra work for people now, after they've gone back to work for COVID, it's a very tough job. \n\nAnd in my opinion, it'd be great if the government kind of provided more resources to the folks at the IRS. So when you call and luckily you don't have to call and ask about a power of attorney anymore, but when you do call, be nice, they are very nice people, smart people that will help you out. So hope that helps. \n\nIf you have any questions on this, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com, but we look forward to doing your power of attorneys electronically from now on, thank you.",

      "description": "Is angel investing tax deductible?\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question, is angel investing tax deductible for the investor? \n\nAnd when someone asked me this question recently, I was like, wow, wouldn't that be amazing? Sometimes it does feel like you're giving money to charity when you do angel investing, but angel investing is really the heart and soul of the startup ecosystem and the venture capital ecosystem. And it's really important. And the cool thing about angel investing is when you get into a good company early at a really low valuation, you can make crazy amounts of money, especially when the company goes IPO or gets bought for a big valuation. And guess what? That helps subsidize the companies that didn't make it. \n\nAnd so the investment in a company is not tax deductible, but guess what? There's an added bonus. Say, the companies you invest in, one or two out of 10 are big hits and you're making money there, which is great. But the other ones don't quite work out, which is kind of like the ratio for angel investing. Well, the losses on the company, when it goes, unfortunately shuts down and goes bankrupt, that is tax deductible. \n\nSo you can take a capital gains loss on the investment when the company shuts down. Oftentimes your friendly CPA will ask you for proof the company shut down, or the Delaware franchise tax filing for basically withdrawing the Delaware franchise, Delaware corporation, whatever it is, just some type of proof that the company did go down and not make it. But all that money you put into the company that didn't make it can go to an offset on your gains for the companies that did make it. And so it's kind of like a really nice little thing about angel investing. \n\nYes, some don't make it despite the founder's best efforts, but that's a tax write off when it finally doesn't make it. So hope that helps. It's again, angel investing, super-important for the startup ecosystem. We love you angel investors and keep taking big swings and making the entrepreneurial economy possible. \n\nAnd if you have any other questions on this, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com, thanks.",

      "title": "Should You Offer Cryptocurrency Payroll?",
      "description": "Should You Offer Cryptocurrency Payroll?\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nI always have to be the bearer of bad news on this because it's not the greatest thing to do. I know that you as someone who believes in cryptocurrency want to, you know be an early adopter and get it going. But the major payroll companies that we work with like Rippling and Gusto and Justworks and Tri-Net, Sequoia, they don't really accept cryptocurrency or don't facilitate paying via cryptocurrency. \n\nAnd so then what happens is we have companies or founders that decide just to send the payment via like Coinbase or another mechanism like Square's app, Cash app, or any other different way but they're not taking payroll taxes out of those payments. And that is a huge no-no for the IRS. The IRS really cares about payroll taxes. They are very smart. They figure out when you haven't been paying payroll taxes on something you should have. And so you can end up paying a lot of penalties and a ton of negative paperwork if you just don't use a payroll app at all to make these payments. \n\nThe other thing that's hard about these like just direct cryptocurrency payments especially to like a contractor, say you decide that you're taking my advice. You're not gonna run payroll via cryptocurrency but you do wanna pay your contractors. Well, that's okay 'cause you're not, you know, avoiding payroll taxes but it makes the calculations and accounting for all those transactions a lot more difficult. So at Kruze, we're still waiting for like that magical moment when we can actually just get the when the crypto currency payment goes through like say you paid someone in Bitcoin or Ethereum and we actually get the exact dollar amounts in our accounting software. \n\nRight now the way we have to do it is treat each one of those crypto payments as basically like a foreign currency payment and do the calculations to figure out what the actual currency was on that day or the average of the day or average of the week. And so it makes the accounting for it a lot more difficult. Also, if you're using something like bill.com where you're saving the invoices for those contractors, which you should those invoices are getting synced into QuickBooks. The payment in cryptocurrency, outside of bill.com will not always match in dollar terms with the invoices inside of bill.com. \n\nAnd so we end up in this situation where we're spending a lot of time trying to match each cryptocurrency payment which often the app that was used are not really marked or itemized or labeled for the vendor very well at all. Most of the time, not labeled for the vendor. And we're trying to match those to invoices in bill.com so we can cancel out or basically offset that invoice. So there's just a lot of problems on the accounting side if you're trying to pay payroll or contractors through cryptocurrency. I totally get why you wanna do it. And this is how things go mainstream. When people are early adopters and start pressing use cases. I am excited though because there are accounting software companies starting to get funded who will be able to solve this problem. \n\nSo, like for example, there's a company called TaxBit which was funded out of Utah which raised a hundred million dollars. And their whole goal is to do better accounting around crypto transactions. And I can envision a day where TaxBit or someone else who also is funded has some real serious software. Will be able just to send a bank feed into QuickBooks that the accountants like us will be able to use to make things really easy. And by the way, it's not just the QuickBooks that depends on those accounting feeds, or the bank feeds. Kruze Consulting depends on those bank feeds like we have a bunch of info coming in from Plaid as well. \n\nSo having better bank feeds from those crypto payment apps will actually be the real unlocking of being able to run crypto payroll and crypto currency payments to your contractors. So, I know there's a lot to think about but please keep it simple right now as a startup. Give the time for some of these apps to get built, for them to be bulletproof. And then I will fully endorse paying people through crypto whether through payroll or whether it's through contractors. \n\nBut right now it's really tough. And as a startup, you're building company, you wanna focus on your company and build your company. Let these other tool providers catch up to what you want. I hope that helps. Thanks so much, take care.",

Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn. Today we're going to do a venture debt scattering report on Silicon Valley Bank. SVB is one of the largest players in the venture debt market. They've been servicing start-ups for many, many years. The bank has grown a lot so it has a huge balance sheet and it can do lots of deals and imaginative deals. They can get very creative with start-ups. They typically are very inexpensive. They have low-interest rates and low warrant coverage, which is awesome for the start-up. The only negatives are they typically use investor abandonment clauses, which means that if your investors refuse to fund the company when they request it, they can create a default. The other negative is sometimes they'll use covenants to make sure you're hitting plan or sometimes ask for a covenant to unleash more money in the future. But, generally speaking, SVB is fantastic. They are one of the market leaders. We love working with them. We have a great team that we work with. Rob Helm, Lee Nguyen and Liam Fairbanks so, in summary, SVB is one of the top players. You should definitely check out SVB if you're gonna get a term sheet for venture debt. I hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "title": "What is a secondary stock transaction?",
      "description": "What is a secondary stock transaction?\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today I'm answering the question, what is a secondary stock transaction? \n\nAnd, you know, we're recording this late 2020, the stock market and venture capital market are very frothy, on fire and so there are a lot of secondary transactions happening. Meaning, a lot of venture capital firms are buying basically the founder shares or previous VC investors shares in the company. So think of a secondary transaction as it's kind of, it's the opposite of a primary share which is when a venture capitalist puts money into the company immediately, directly they're buying primary shares, like they're buying those shares from the company, they're created to sell to those VCs same thing with founders when they establish the company, they're granted a bunch of stock, those are primary shares. \n\nWhen they resell those shares, that is a secondary transaction. And so you might say like, why are people doing secondaries right now with the market being so hot? Well, there's a couple of reasons. For founders or employees, it can be a really nice source of liquidity. Maybe you can, if you have a super successful company you can buy a house, put a down payment on something. For VCs they want to get into these companies, and maybe they can't buy any preferred stock because the round is oversubscribed. And so the only option is to buy secondary shares, from the founders or maybe a VC firm that wants to sell out. Although that's a lot less rare, a lot more rare, excuse me. \n\nThe other reason is VCs will sometimes do a small secondary of the founder shares to give the founder some money in their pocket and so they're actually more risk seeking, meaning the founder feels financially secure and can take bigger risks, go for a bigger outcome. Venture capitalists really value the big outcomes, like the IPO, that's what returns their fund and makes them money. And so they want to be aligned with the founders. And so letting the founder take a little bit of money off the table, like I said maybe buy a house, do something so they feel secure, actually aligns the risk reward paradigm a lot better for the VCs and the founders. \n\nAnd so, now a lot of people think, hey I can just go in and buy some secondary shares. Well, it turns out there's something called a ROFR, or right of first refusal that most VC firms get in their stock purchase agreements and the articles of incorporation with the company, meaning, the internal venture capitalists get the first bite of the apple. They have to waive their right to buy those secondary shares before an outside VC firm or individual can come in. \n\nNow that's not always the case. I believe back in the day Twitter and Facebook didn't have that, right or maybe their VCs just always waived the right of first refusal, but there was a really big secondary markets in those stocks. And so remember you have to get the internal VC's permission typically, to do a secondary sale. The other thing to think about is people typically think secondary sales are always the common stock of the founders, which it could be your management team, but actually there's a lot of secondary sales of funds, especially for funds that are very old, maybe have been around for 10 to 15 years, and the fund life is winding down. There's an entire market for fund sales called secondaries where a fund just sells all their ownership positions, all their stock and then kind of cashes out. \n\nSo there's a lot going on in secondary sales, but it's becoming more and more prevalent, I think partly because the market is so hot, but also investors and founders and managed teams are just getting more sophisticated, and they realize unlocking a little bit of a liquidity for the team can really help and align everyone for the big outcome. \n\nI hope that helps.

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nLooking for advice setting up your startups HR, finance, and payroll infrastructure? Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health\n\nThe first determinant I would make is whether this is a temporary move for that employee, or whether it's permanent. If it's temporary, you're in really good shape, I wouldn't do anything, I would just leave it alone. \n\nNow if it's permanent, that's a much bigger deal because a lot of these employees, when they move to that lower cost geography, also wanna pay lower payroll tax rates. And so we'll get into payroll tax rates in a second, but that necessitates actually making like a permanent adjustment in the payroll system, and also registering to do business in that state, pay payroll taxes, there's a lot of like work for the company. Now in terms of what to pay those employees, we are seeing a few companies make those adjustments. They're actually reducing it based on the standard of living in that geography. \n\nNow my advice if you're gonna do that is to make it a super clear communication with the employees and do it as soon as possible. \n\nSo personally, I would not make salary adjustments, especially in the middle of COVID when there's so much uncertainty, and people's anxiety levels are really, really high. \n\nAt Kruze, we're not doing that. We're letting people move wherever they want. \n\nBut that's just another thing to consider. We've actually made another video talking about the tax ramifications, state and local. So check that out on our Kruze video site. So again, if you're gonna make a salary reduction based on a geography and a lower cost of living, communicate very clearly, make sure you are using data to make that change, and also really think twice about it because you may be opening yourself up for some of your employees to get poached.",

      "description": "What is a Right of First Refusal (ROFR)?\n\nRaising venture debt? Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today I'm answering the question, what is the Right of First Refusal when it comes to startup equity? \n\nAnd, you know, oftentimes this term will actually be called a ROFR, it's the initials of all Right Of First Refusal. It's kind of like the classic venture capital or legal thing where people like to throw big words around or abbreviations that the normal people like us don't actually know. But luckily you have an accounting firm, Kruze Consulting, who's willing to explain this stuff to you. So, yipee! So Right of First Refusal is something that's actually negotiated by the venture capitalists in your stock purchase agreement. \n\nAnd basically what that says is, \"Hey, we the venture capitalists, if someone,\" you know on the inside of the executive team, common stock holders wants to or even preferred, this actually can apply to other preferred, but much less often preferred. It's mostly about common stock holders. If they wanna sell some stock, they have to come to us, the venture capitalists, because we have a Right of First Refusal, we get to make the first offer. And the reason for that is the VCs, most VCs typically in good companies always want more ownership. They're professional investors. That's all they do is have money and they buy stock. They buy stock in good companies, hopefully and so they always wanna increase their ownership. \n\nThere's a secondary issue here in that like if the founding, the executive team or employees start selling stock to outsiders, there could be information rights transferred where all of a sudden the actual financial results of those companies get out. Now there's some other language usually in a stock purchase agreement that blocks, you know that you only have information rights if you own a certain amount of a company, but still what kind of happens is there's, this becomes like a wild secondary market in stock for private companies and I think generally speaking most companies try to do an IPO, Initial Public Offering and sell stock in a very organized way and try not to have like a lot of stock trading outside the company's control. \n\nThis really came to a head when Facebook and Twitter, probably like 10 years ago, 11 years ago, 12 years ago when they were in their huge ramp and running towards an IPO. A lot of Twitter and Facebook folks were able to sell stock or get around ROFRs or those companies didn't have them. I'm not sure if they had them or not, but they were able to sell stock to just everyday people or funds and so there became like just a lot of outside ownership in those companies, which was great for the people who were able to buy the stock and also great for the employees who are able to sell some take some liquidity and then get to the IPO. \n\nSo typically the venture capitalists though they wanna maximize their ownership, so it was a little problematic for them and it had a bunch of secondary consequences so companies have gotten a little tighter on ROFRs that said venture capital firms are a lot more willing to do a secondary buy, which means buying though they'll put their initial investment in which is primary shares, the company issues shares to the VC. \n\nThat's a primary transaction, but a lot of VC firms are more willing to do secondary sales nowadays where they'll buy like a million or $2 million or $3 million of stock from the founders as part of our primary transaction. So in a way that Facebook, Twitter and all the other success, the Valley and New York and Santa Monica have had recently has kind of loosened investors up to they're more willing to buy secondary pieces but they still like to enforce the Right of First Refusal or ROFR so that they can, you know buy as much stock as possible before any employees sell it to the outsiders. \n\nSo I hope that helps, if you are working at a venture backed startup it's very high likelihood that your company has a ROFR so you're just gonna have to work through the proper channels, The CFO, the accounting firm, the general counsel, sometimes the founder handles this stuff too but just make sure you get permission and make sure you do it in the right way. You don't want anything invalidated or anything weird happen. So hope that helps. Hope the definition of Right of First Refusal makes sense to you. Thanks. Bye.",

      "description": "Trump Organization Tax Fraud Case - Lessons for Startups\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn of Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about the tax treatment on perks for employees that are, perks that employees receive from companies. And what brought this up is I was reading the news that the Trump organization's CFO has been indicted for tax fraud. \n\nAnd it was about, I think it was like $1.75 million of tax fraud here. And basically, what it comes down to is I started seeing that, I started reading the list, and it was all things that startup founders ask us if they can do for their own companies and themselves. And so I thought it would make, this would be a very real life example for everyone. So, you know, hopefully this comes across as well intentioned here. But basically the Trump CFO, I think his name is Allen Weisselberg. He was not reporting indirect income on his W2, which is what the federal government uses to track your income. So it was stuff like the Trump organization was paying for his apartments. And they were paying for his cars. And they were paying for private school tuition, utility expenses, garage expenses, all these things that are called perks or indirect income that was making his life a lot better. And guess what? He was not running this through payroll and paying payroll taxes. \n\nSo it's perfectly fine for the company to pay for this stuff if it wants, but it needs to be taxed. The IRS, you know, deserves the taxes from this type of income, even though it's not in your salary. And so the correct way to do this is to add line items on the payroll every month for the employees who get these kinds of perks. And have them pay tax on it and have the company pay tax on it. But the Trump organization was not doing this. The only way the IRS caught this was, he had been keeping detailed records, like a good accountant would, of all these different expenses that he was running through the company, but not paying taxes on. \n\nSo your startup can learn from this. Like, don't pay a rent on behalf of the founders, don't pay for the gym, don't pay for, you know, cars or other kinds of stuff. That is illegal. The IRS, you know, they're doing their best to audit this kind of stuff. They may not catch you, but you wanna do things the right way. When you're doing a startup you're trying to build a giant company. You're not trying to save a few bucks on your apartment, right? So learn from this real life example. \n\nAnd if you have any questions hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com. We answer this question, I would say once a week from a founder who's well-intentioned, and is trying to figure out what's reasonable, and what they can expense, and what needs to be run through payroll taxes. So just remember if it feels too good to be true, and you're getting a bunch of stuff paid for by the company, it means you probably need to be running that through payroll taxes. You don't wanna end up working with the IRS in a hard way, or the feds knocking at your door someday. Hope that helps, thanks.",

      "description": "Can I retroactively apply for PPP 1?\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today I'm answering the question, can my startup apply for a PPP loan retroactively? \n\nAnd really, this is a question I'm getting quite a bit from startups who didn't apply in March, April and May last year but who were eligible and there's a variety of reasons why companies didn't apply maybe they felt some pressure or they didn't have other funding sources or whatever it is. \n\nIf you are eligible and you were eligible at that time, the new PPP 2 laws actually let startups or other companies apply, it's called a first draw PPP and you are not subject to the rules around PPP 2 which say like you basically have to have a 25% reduction, quarterly reduction in gross receipts. And so if your company passed or just didn't do it last year in 2020 but wanna do it or wants to do it now you can actually apply. The guidance and the guidelines are exactly the same. \n\nAgain, you are not subject if this is your first time, you are not subject to the 25% reduction in gross receipts but you do have to warrant that this is needed that your company was affected by COVID and you do have to list out all your 20% shareholders which are typically gonna be VC funds. So, the affiliation laws are still in play. There was a lot of affiliate concern around affiliation laws and basically what that means is if you're startup is owned, has a significant amount of ownership, VC fund has a significant amount of ownership in your startup and in many other startups you essentially pool those together and it can disqualify you. \n\nThere was some movement and it made it a little bit easier for VC backed startups to do PPP despite some of the affiliation stuff but it's not like super clear, it's not like very obvious whether you qualify or not so that's something you should talk to your attorneys, talk to your accountants about, but again the headline is if you passed or just didn't do PPP 1, but would like to and you still qualify and your company was affected by COVID, you can do it in this new round of PPP 2 it's called a first draw loan. \n\nTons of paperwork, tons of information online, SBA has a lot of good resources and you are eligible. Hope that helps, thanks.",

But, the first thing to remember is, a venture capital firm is always gonna want you to be a Delaware C corporation. And that's for a couple reasons. A, everyone understands case law, it's a very business friendly, place to do business, especially with VC firms, and, venture capital firms have a pretty complicated tax structure because they have all these limited partners who invest in them, and so they can't afford to have like LLCs, or S Corps, or things like that that are passed through. So they're always gonna ask you to be a Delaware C Corp. \n\nSo, getting fancy, and maybe out thinking you're outsmarting someone by changing your incorporation state or things like that, I don't recommend that. Now, someone might say, you know, and I also wanna be specific here. This is different than being a Delaware C Corp and then just hiring someone in New York, or California, or Texas, or Florida, or wherever, where you are going to be employing people there, create tax nexus and have to register to do business in that state and pay some taxes. So the question I'm answering here is not that. \n\nIf you are just hiring people in a state and you're gonna conduct business there, well you just register, you pay some taxes, it's pretty easy, very straightforward. You will file a state tax, income tax form every year along with your federal return. But what I'm talking about is maybe someone trying to game the system. Maybe they're like a California C Corp, or a New York C Corp, and maybe they think they can take advantage of like R&D Tax Credits for another year. There's basically like once you hit revenue you have like five years to be able to use the payroll tax offset, right? And so they might think like, \"Oh my gosh, I'm gonna get really fancy here, and take my California C Corp and make it a Delaware C Corp and reset the clock on the R&D Tax Credit.\" \n\nWell, that doesn't work. And the reason why it doesn't work is the IRS follows EIN numbers. That is the tax number you are associated with in the IRS system, that doesn't change whether you're a Delaware C Corp, or a California C Corp, whatever kind of company you are, that, you are stuck with that, that's how they're gonna evaluate your tax return and any historical things like the five year limit on payroll tax offsets from R&D Tax Credit. \n\nSo, I hope this is definitely a more complicated question but I, it's a question I actually got from a client who I think was getting a little creative. And just in startups, this kind of stuff, always keep it simple. It's so hard to build a startup. There's so many things going on, there's so many demands on your time and your people. This is an example of someone probably overthinking it a little bit and they weren't really gonna get anywhere anyways. \n\nNow, luckily they had, they were a Kruze client, so they had a CPA firm to ask this question for, and they didn't spend a lot of money and time on it, but, just keep it simple. Keep your Delaware C Corp, don't try to move around in corporation states or anything like that. And then, you know, as a best practice if you do hire someone in another state or have assets or property, or generating quite a bit of revenue in that state, you will have to start filing tax returns in that state and register to do business in that state. \n\nHope that helps, if you have any other questions on this or other tax issues, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com.

      "description": "How do early stage VCs find the startups to invest in?\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nThe first one is, you know, and this is really new, like Fred Wilson, Bill Gurley. Some of the older VCs have been doing this for a long time, is building their brand, producing content, and just general advice. And now, you see in the VC world, First Round Capital has an amazing newsletter. Andreessen Horowitz is basically kicking off like a whole kind of media company. Fred Wilson's blog is still legendary. Bill Gurley's blog is legendary when he writes it. There's a lot of VCs on Twitter. What these venture capitalists have realized is by putting out content or messaging about industries or concepts they find interesting, it's actually a great way to help startup founders find them. So, you know, the reverse of this would be like the summit model. Someone's a very, very successful VC fund, but later stage and they just cold call and do a lot of direct marketing to business owners. \n\nWell, what a lot of the venture capitalists realized in the startup world is it's so hard to know who to call or who to reach out. And a lot of the best ideas come from the fringes. And so by putting out content, and demonstrating the kind of advice, and how smart they are and how they can help your company, they can generate a lot of really great deal flow that way. So that's number one. \n\nNumber two, existing portfolio company management teams aka other founders they've invested in. This is definitely the number two right here. It's a huge validation for a venture capitalist when another founder introduces them to a company or startup or founder that's doing something really interesting because oftentimes, like the founders of the portfolio companies are the most in tune with what's happening in the market. They also have these like implicit filters that allow them to see like, is this founder a good decision maker? Are they organized? Can they move quickly? Can they recruit talent? Is their idea super interesting? Is there a big market opportunity for this idea? The founder that's making this intro is typically already gone through that whole filter set. \n\nAnd if they're making the intro to the VC, which is an important relationship for them, that means it's something interesting and the venture capitalist should really pay attention. So I think there's maybe less of these than some of the other channels, but they're the highest validation. Maybe, even the most important, because I think more times than not, these are the ones that lead to an investment. And I can look at the Kruze Consulting client portfolio because we have a lot of relationships with a lot of VC firms and a lot of founders. And I can tell who made the intros to who and often ask that question. \n\nNumber three is angel investors, especially if you're like a seed stage or series A fund, angel investors can be another great kind of \"scouting system\" for you because angels, oftentimes, are wealthy individuals or people who've been very successful in the corporate world. Like maybe people worked at Facebook or Uber, Google, whatever, and have some extra money. And so they're going around investing in companies that they find interesting. \n\nAnd then it was a 20, $25 million fund. Now, some seed stage funds are getting like 50, $70 million, especially for the smaller ones, you're kind of capital constrained. And you know that you need to make a lot of bets as a seed stage fund because the failure rate is really, really high. And so, what you often see with seed stage funds is they partner up with other seed stage funds. You might see like Precursor and Homebrew do a deal together, you know, to pick just a couple folks we're familiar with. Because they know, maybe one of the seed stage funds wants to do a million, but they know this company actually needs $3 million in capital at the seed stage. And so they're going to bring in one of their funds they're friendly with, but who also kind of is like-minded. \n\nNext up, I talked about this a little bit, but cold emails. And there's really kind of an art to cold emails. Jason Lemkin at SaaStr talks about this all the time. He has some really good posts on this. But when you're running a cold email, you do not want to overwhelm the VC with a bunch of text, like giant, giant paragraphs. You want to start off with a very simple one sentence or two sentence; what your company does. So for Kruze Consulting it's we do accounting and taxes for startups. And at this point when I'm recording the video in the middle of 2021, we have over 500 clients. Right? That would be what I would send to the VC. Like that's a very quick summary of what we do.",

Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHi. It's Scott Orn. Today we're doing another venture debt report. This time we're talking about Triplepoint. Triplepoint's a very large fund, a very aggressive lender in the venture debt market place. It was started by Jim Labe, who came out of Comdisco, which one of the forefathers of venture debt entire industry. So they know what they're doing. They have a long track record. And because of that, they've been able to raise a lot of capital and can do very aggressive deals. So if you're looking for a very large dollar amount, flexible terms, Triplepoint is a great provider. We love our representative that we work with Aaron Tyler, who predominantly works on the east coast, but does everything across the nation. He's great to work with. Triplepoint, again, is aggressive. They'll structure forward commitments so you don't have to draw the money down right away. And they typically do big dollar amounts. Only negatives of Triplepoint are they tend to be an expensive firm, and that's because they actually let you use the money. So again, you're seeing that higher interest rates, higher warrant coverage, comes with working with the funds who actually let you draw the money down with very few restrictions. With that said, I always value low restrictions and being able to use the capital, and always recommend our start ups should look in that direction if possible. So in summary, Triplepoint's a great firm to talk to. They have huge capital base, and they can do a lot of creative deals. They're great. And I think they actually really enjoy those creative deals, so talk to them if you're in the market for venture debt. Thanks.",

      "description": "Should your startup switch to unlimited PTO?\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nThere's a couple different reasons why companies do this, one of the first ones is, it's kind of flashy. It sounds really cool to new recruits, which makes the actual recruiting process a little easier, especially like hard to find engineers. People like the concept of unlimited PTO. There's also a financial benefit to the company that's probably driving a lot of this to be honest with you, which is, when someone leaves, especially like the states like California and New York, when someone leaves the company, you are technically required to pay them their outstanding PTO they never took on vacation. This is something you actually have to pay them within, different states have different requirements, but the first 24 or 48 hours usually. \n\nAnd so that's a liability the company incurs along the way, and it's real cash. Like if you have someone with two or three weeks of vacation per year, they're not taking very much vacation. You're actually going to owe them a decent amount of money. And so some companies are like, \"Hey, great we get the flashiness on the recruiting side and guess what, we're not gonna have to pay people when they leave. Like how great is that? We're saving a bunch of money.\" And so that's what's driving the unlimited PTO trend. My opinion, I'm actually slightly negative on unlimited PTO. And I have a couple of reasons why. \n\nFirst, there's the cultural problems. So you kind of have two buckets of people. The first more obvious bucket is people who abuse it and take too much PTO. So you have the people who just decide they're going to take every Friday off, like that's 50 days or probably 40 days a year. That kind of thing. You have the people who are going to take a three or four week vacation cause they have unlimited PTO. And it's hard for the people who are managing the organization, especially the middle management layer to push back against a definitive company policy and say, \"Hey, you can't take PTO.\" Like after all, there is an unlimited PTO policy at the company. \n\nSo that's a problem. And it does put pressure on the management team, especially middle management, which is when you get going, you're scaling as a startup it's actually maybe your most important layer, like that middle manager layer is really transferring the culture, the process, how we do things here. And so adding another thing, especially if you're going through hyper-growth is very difficult there. The second issue I see is, and this is, I've seen this documented in a bunch of places in surveys, people who have unlimited PTO, actually most of them perversely take less PTO. In fact, they don't take enough PTO. \n\nAnd so what happens is, there's this building resentment slash burnout that can really creep into an organization and you can fight this a little bit by just encouraging and messaging people to take PTO and reminding them it's unlimited. But there's this, it's just hard mentally when they're not looking in their payroll account and seeing the number of days of vacation they have, or feel like that time is owed to them, for some people to take the time off. And so the nightmare scenario is those people burn out. They start lashing out and they actually create a very, very expensive HR problem at your company. Where you're starting to lose good people. Maybe there's some abuse or, you know, stuff like that. All because someone who normally would have been a fine actor, a nice contributor just got burned out because they weren't taking enough PTO. \n\nSo, that's, you know, again, when you're doing unlimited PTO, you're getting rid of the liability and it's nice for a brochure for recruiting, but I really personally don't think the financial benefit of getting rid of that liability is really worth the potential burnout and HR problems you could have with people who aren't taking enough PTO. And then also you've got this middle management layer, who's really having to enforce this policy and make decisions in the field that are tough to justify sometimes. So, you know, I definitely see the benefit of it. I understand why some startups do it, but I personally just recommend people have a PTO policy. \n\nThat's how we do it at Kruze. We have a PTL policy. People get paid out when they leave, we monitor it. We really encourage people to take vacation. It's very healthy. It's healthy for the organization long-term. So that's my 2 cents, that's what I recommend. If you have any questions or comments hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com. We'd love to answer your questions. \n\nHappy to listen to your viewpoint as well, especially if you've worked in an organization that has unlimited PTO. Hope that helps, thanks.",

      "title": "How startups can modify their office leases during COVID to cut burn",
      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about startup office leases. And what do you do if you're in a really tough situation? \n\nSo with COVID hitting, lots of companies are not even using their offices. Office space is one of the largest burn, like cash burn or expenses, for a startup. So a lot of people are trying to figure this out. Now, a couple of things for a background. Office leases are actually unsecured debt. Like, you cannot just like get out of an office lease. That is debt on your company. So you got to be really careful on how you handle this. \n\nSecondly, a little bit more background. For a very long time, startup office leases in San Francisco, New York, Austin, they've all been going up in price for a long time. And so people didn't always really worry too much about how long their lease duration was because they figured they could always sublease it out. And that was true. Because the market was always going up, subleasing out always was a better deal for someone. So someone would always take that lease. Now, with COVID hitting, prices have plummeted. And so it's really tough to get out of a lease. So we've got four different solutions for you. \n\nSo the first solution is you can quote-unquote play hardball. Now we do not recommend this. But playing hardball would be, \"Hey, Mr or Mrs. Landlord. \"I'm just not gonna pay you for a few months,\" and see what happens. Now, sometimes people think that's a good solution. But it's really not because again, this is unsecured debt on your company. Furthermore, you've typically put down a deposit, one to three months or so, or you've signed a letter of credit with the bank that the landlord can draw down upon for collateral. So if you stop paying for a few months, they're just gonna use your deposit or they're gonna draw down to your letter of credit. \n\nAnd I know a lot of startup people have been surprised that letters of credit have been getting drawn down upon. But that's just kinda how it works. That's what letters of credit do. So the other thing to worry about if you play hardball is that in these leases there's a lot of penalties and fees that the landlords can rack up on you. They can also just take you to court for some of the like more qualitative but very dangerous terms where you're causing financial damage to them. So all of a sudden the liability gets really big if you stop paying. So we do not recommend doing that. \n\nInstead, we recommend working with your landlord. So there's a couple different ways. Now, the first one is working with your landlord to find a subletter. This is really tough. You've probably already tried doing that. What we are seeing is prices are down 25 to 50% in the big metros. So if you can get a subletter, you're probably gonna be subsidizing them by paying 25 to 50% rent. So you've got to figure out if that's even really worth it for you. But you do get out of that liability if you do sublet it. \n\nThe next option, which is probably my favorite, is blend and extend. And what that means is you go to the landlord and you say, \"Hey, I will sign up for another year on my lease \"on the backend under the assumption that the market \"will get better, we'll get through COVID and office space \"will be in more demand.\" So you don't really mind doing that. In exchange, you will get a lower payment for the next year or two. So the landlord wins because they're extending the lease and you win as a startup because you're blending the high payment you used to pay with a much lower payment in the near term. And this is the most cashflow-friendly way because you're really reducing your payments when it matters most. \n\nNow the fourth option is a variation of that. But what you would do is actually go to your landlord and say, \"Hey, instead of extending, \"I will just buy out the lease.\" Now, this is again, landlords, not their favorite thing because they really like having long-term leases. But if you make it worth their while by paying six months to a year worth of payments upfront, you can usually get out of the lease. That gives the property back to the landlord. They've got a bunch of cash up front. And then they can try to lease it again. Now, the problem for a startup is the cashflow burden is really huge upfront, kinda when you don't wanna do it. You wanna push those payments out if possible. And all of a sudden you're paying six months to a year worth of lease payments right away. So it is pretty painful. But if you think there's no way that you're ever gonna use this lease and there's no way to get a subletter, and you don't wanna extend it, then doing the buyout is the best option. So I hope that helps. \n\nThere are four options. None of them are super-fun. None of them are super-easy. But times are tough and it's time to take evasive action if the office lease is really hurting your company. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "Startup Financial Planning.\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\n1- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), to drive their financial model, which is in my opinion, the right way to do it. So, you have certain KPIs, maybe average selling price, number of customers, on the development side there might be things like number of engineers, productivity per engineer, things like that. There's some usually three to four maybe five KPIs you wanna use to really drive your business. And typically the KPIs will, some of them at least, will drive your revenue. And so most people kind of start from the top and they go top down. So they use the KPIs to figure out what the revenue projections are gonna be. And then they start thinking about, okay, how do I need to support, or how do I need to build this organization to support that revenue? \n\nThere's one other we really didn't talk about. We talked a lot about people, but we didn't talk about some of the more CapEx heavy companies like biotech or manufacturing or robotics, for those companies you have to plan ahead on your capital expenditures. And so you really need to know how much equipment do I need to buy? When's it gonna be delivered? Do I need any accessories with that equipment? Planning for a hardware or biotech, MedTech company, robotics company is actually a lot harder than just a pure like SaaS or consumer internet company. \n\n2- Fundraising. And typically startups raise money on an 18 month cycle. So, and some startups raise every 12 months, some every 24 months, but 18 months is a good average. \n\n3- Board Approval. Typically the boards actually sometimes even in the stock purchase agreement, investor rights agreements they will include that they have the right to approve the financial plan for the year. So you're gonna wanna present that budget to the board. Now, I like to get all this done in December if possible, maybe January. The reason for that is  if you can get everything nailed down, board approved in December, you're going right into January. You're collecting resumes already. You're gonna be interviewing and you can usually hire those people that you need by the end of January or February. If you're getting this board deck and board presentation approved in January, it puts you kind of a month delay and that's not a huge deal. \n\nMost recruiting doesn't really turn up until end of January. But just earlier is better. You also need to build in some buffer time because you're gonna need to have some conversations with your board. I would not just present the plan like, \"Wow. Here it is.\" I would be having side conversations with them while you're building it, checking in, making sure you are consistent with what their assumptions are. And it's very common for board members to not approve the plan on first blush and send you back to the drawing board a little bit. And often they just wanna see a more aggressive plan. Like they've invested a lot of capital in this company. They wanna see it produce big numbers. They wanna see a big exit out of it. And so they're gonna challenge you to just be more aggressive. So just prepare for that. \n\nBut ideally you'll have the board meeting in late December or January and it'll be ready to go and you'd be ready to start recruiting. And then the final aspect of financial planning for 2021 is really the execution aspect. And a lot of it is getting those orders in for CapEx, getting HR, getting recruiting ramped up, making the time in your schedule and team members' schedules to actually do the interviewing and attract really good people. I mean, that is just so important. One of the big reasons I see our clients miss their numbers, if they do miss is because their plan was predicated on bringing a certain number of contributors, whether it's developers or salespeople into the organization. And they're just late hiring those people. \n\nAnd so, by default, they just end up missing their numbers by a quarter. So, the faster you can execute on this plan, get those people in the door, start making positive progress in 2021. You're just gonna be better off and it's gonna show. Your valuation will go up if you're raising more money. You have more traction. You'll have happier team and you'll have a happier board. \n\nAnd most importantly, you'll have a happier you the executive team of the startup. So I hope this helps. Please don't wait. Don't procrastinate. Now's the time to start planning for 2021. Get that financial plan done. You'll sleep better. You'll enjoy the holidays more and you'll have just a great start on 2021. Thanks.",

      "description": "My employer changed to PEO mid-year, how does that affect my personal taxes and my W2s?\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're answering the question, My employer, my startup, that I work for, switched to a PEO mid-year, How does that affect my personal taxes and my W2s? \n\nAnd the answer is, it is actually not that complex really, you should get a W2 from your company via the payroll provider that you used to use. So, a lot of companies are on Gusto or Rippling or Intuit payroll. And maybe you switched half, Your company switched halfway through the year. So, you'll get, you know, hypothetically, a W2 from January to June, on the old payroll system. \n\nAnd then when you go to a PEO, you actually technically work for the PEO, a professional employment organization and then you kinda have like a side relationship with your startup You work at this is how PEOs are able to pool all the employees and get really great healthcare benefit costs because they can kind of pull everything and have better negotiations. So technically you work for that PEO. so you will also get a W2 for the second half of the year wages directly from the PEO and it will actually come from the PEO, not your company. \n\nAnd so you should get two W2s and W2s are basically the statement that tells you what you made what your gross wages were and all the deductions like 401k and and some of that stuff, taxes, things like that. So, if you're company switched to a PEO and you only got one W2 you need to look at that and figure out who it came from. Your old payroll provider or your new PEO and make sure you're the squeaky wheel and get a second W2. So you can fill out your taxes correctly. A lot of people think if they don't get a W2 or a 1099 they don't have to declare those wages or payments on their taxes. \n\nBut guess what? The IRS actually gets notified in a different way and knows that you didn't declare and they will find you and audit you eventually. I hope it doesn't happen to you, but it happens quite a bit. \n\nSo even if you don't get the W2 because of some paperwork problem or you don't get a 1099, because of some paperwork problem you still need to declare all those earnings on your personal tax return. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

I'm Vanessa, from Kruze Consulting. Today I wanted to go over with you guys a couple of the basics you need to think about when you're creating a financial model for your start-up. There are really five things. First of which, you do need three years worth of projections. Some folks will think, “Oh, maybe I just need one, or maybe I need five,” the answer is, keep it to three years. Next up, do make sure that you have a three statement financial model. That means a PNL, a balance sheet, and a statement of cash flows. Some folks will just go straight to the income statement and then leave it as-is. But the real answer is, make sure that you have all three of those statements, tying back together. Third, you are going to wanna make sure that you're using your KPIs as your drivers. Those are things like your number of users, your cost to acquire a customer or your MRR. Those are the things again, that should really be making your financial model move. Next up, do think about churn. Customers who wanna leave, you should account for that. It really just keeps your financial model a little bit more honest. Last but not least, do make sure that you add in waterfalls. Waterfalls help keep your financial model dynamic because as you guys all know, things don't always go to plan. So you need to make sure that your financial model isn't completely broken when you've either exceeded your goals, or you've kinda fallen a little bit behind. So again, it's a three statement financial model, three years worth of projections, KPIs should be your drivers, do account for churn, and last but not least, the waterfalls. Thanks again for listening. I'm Vanessa, and we'll see you soon.",

      "description": "How much should I reimburse employees for a home office?\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nHey, is Scott Orn, Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question, how much should my startup reimburse employees for home office equipment? So, all of us have found ourselves with COVID working at home even if we don't want to. And a lot of team members have really sub-optimal equipment setups, like they don't have enough monitors or keyboards or computer or whatever it is. So you really want to take care of your  employees. \n\nThe average amount we're seeing our startups and what we're recommending is right around $1,000. So, $1,000 will typically cover everything your employees need to have a really nice workstation at home. Now, that's the dollar amount. And we see some companies spending $500 and we see some being super generous and doing $2,000. But $1,000 is right around the right number. That's what I would go with. \n\nNow, the second part of this question is, how do I execute on it? Because there's a lot of logistics here and there's some payroll tax issues you don't want to mess up and some IRS issues you don't wanna mess up. So just let me go through the four ways of doing this. The first way is to have a very centralized process. Have your operations team have a list of equipment that every employee should have and just go boom. Fire away, go on Amazon and buy that stuff with the company credit card. Your operations team will do it. Send it to the employee's house, super easy, very little work for the employees and the operations team can knock this out very, very quickly. That's my favorite way of doing this. \n\nThe second best way is to enable virtual credit cards for your team. We typically put companies on Brex or the American Express virtual startup credit card. You can set up those cards very, very quickly and easily. And set a limit and then tell your employees what the budget is and they can go and buy the equipment for themselves, have it shipped to them. And because it's on a company credit card, it comes in the company's financials very, very easily. Kruze, other accountants, are gonna be very comfortable working with this. That's the second easiest way. \n\nThe third easiest is to have the employees use their personal credit cards and expense their purchases. Now, the danger in this is you're starting to use a lot of employee time. Like they have to buy the equipment, they have to fill out the expense report, someone has to scrutinize that expense report and make sure it came in under budget. The IRS requires you to do an expense report if you're not using the company's credit card. So, you're starting to kind of waste a lot of time here. So just be careful with this, but Expensify and then or Tallie, Emburse are actually very good platforms that can do this fairly quickly, but it's not quite as easy as the first two options. \n\nThe fourth option which we do see some companies doing just because it's so easy is I'm just kinda say this like sending money. Like, \"Basically here's a thousand bucks, go do what you want with it, buy what you need.\" Now, there's a couple of things you don't wanna mess up on this, because if you just give your employees money that needs to be run through payroll and be treated basically as a bonus and be taxed. So you're probably gonna have to gross it up. So if you are giving people $1,000, you probably got to give them like $1.3 thousand or something like that, right? \n\nThe second problem with this is you actually don't know if the employees bought what they said they were gonna buy. And they may still be working in a sub-optimal work environment because they just valued having the cash more. So, I don't really like this option, but if you're looking for a very quick and easy, something you can do in 15 minutes, then send money slash pay a bonus is the way to do it. \n\nPlease make sure this is run through payroll. Don't mess this up. You'll start getting IRS payroll tax notifications and penalties. It's just such a bummer. So those are the four ways. Again, the number is right around $1,000. And just be smart. Make sure you have a system approach to this. Don't kind of wing it. And pick one of the four options I gave you. It will be easy, it'll be quick, and most importantly your employees will be happy because they'll have all the right equipment, they'll have a comfortable work environment, and they can do their job. \n\nAnd that's what everyone wants in this day and age. Hope that helps. Thanks. Bye.",

Again, they have portfolios just like your venture capital funds have portfolios like the folks that invested in you. \n\nAnd so what you kind of see in the beginnings stages of a tough time, like I remember this from COVID, in 2008, even, I was a baby investment banker in 2000, 2001, but the venture capitalists first pay attention to their own portfolio companies and triage those, get those to a good place. And so they're not super-open for business. They will still take meetings, still look at companies. But a lot of their attention is on their existing portfolio. \n\nSo it makes it hard for them to like lead new investments. You start seeing that when the market hits a bottom, their existing portfolio is triaged, and then they can start thinking kind of opportunistically about new deals. The portion of the cycle we're in right now is the triage existing companies. And so that's why I'm kind of coaching folks in this video on how to ask existing investors for money. Because that's going to be the fastest, the quickest, the easiest. Those people know you, they know your traction, they've been tracking you, they know what kind of person you are, they know how organized, how good of a decision-maker you are. And so and they also have already invested in the company so they have something to protect there. So they are more likely to want to invest in your company. So there's a couple things going on here. There's always going to be the rocket ship companies. \n\nAnd if you are a rocket ship watching this, it's a great time for you. You could probably even raise an up valuation. Run a process. People will pay attention. If you're doing pretty well, this is a really good time to open up the last round of financing and do some extra capital at that valuation. Now, I know that seems so painful and doesn't seem fair. And you probably made a ton of progress off of the last round valuation. Say it was like six months ago or nine months ago. You probably did a lot. The only solace I can give you is that that round was probably raised at a very aggressive valuation. So you did a great job fundraising in that round. You maximized the valuation most likely. So when you reopen that round, you're kind of giving a little bit back to the VCs. They're there when times are tough, they're supporting you, and it's not the worst thing to open up the round at the last valuation. I don't love saying that. It's not the best, my favorite advice, to give you. \n\nSometimes in a tough market, acquirers will re-trade the deal. And so if you have a little bit of extra cash, you can be a little bit more forceful in your no's when they try to re-trade it. And so those are also really good opportunities to raise capital right now. There's something you can really point to that's going to move the needle for the VCs because remember, they do have their ownership position in you, they're existing investors, but this is extra capital. \n\nSo I think the moral of the story is if you've got like 24 months of cash, you're sitting pretty. I wouldn't really do anything. I wouldn't open up the last round. I wouldn't be asking for bridges, anything like that. Maybe raise a little bit of extra venture debt.",

      "description": "5 Ways to Collect Cash Upfront from Customers\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nThe first way is just defaulting it into your agreements and the way you do business. And this is especially a lot easier if it's smaller ticket items because people don't really, you know, freak out if they're having to pay a full year subscription upfront if it's a small item, but you'd be amazed like defaults are just so powerful in our lives, in the world. And just starting with a default pay up front is actually really, really helpful. You may have some negotiations you may have some one-off things, but by and large most people will just default to following directions, especially if they wanna use your application or your service. So default is the first one. The second technique is discount. \n\nAnd this is something that I think the startup world, especially SaaS world is getting more and more in tune with but giving a partial, you know a 5% or 10% discount for cash collections upfront can really trigger a lot of cash collections because there's a lot of vendors out there that have plenty of cash that want to use your service. And if they can save 5% or 10%, well heck, that's really great. That's actually a good return on their capital by prepaying it. \n\nAnd so discounting is probably the best tool for generating cash up front for your startup. The next one is something that's sometimes people don't think about it but incentivizing your sales team to collect cash up front especially in big enterprise deals. Salespeople are very focused on incentives. They tend to be financially oriented. They love the thrill of the sale. They love the thrill of closing a deal and they also love little extra bonuses. \n\nAnd if you can give them an incentive for a higher commission level, if they collect cash up front or cash in the first year, that is really really valuable to your startup, especially for enterprises that are selling two or three year licenses or agreements. Getting year two and year three upfront is huge. Think about that, that's money that can go be reinvested back into your sales team. Be reinvested back into customer acquisition in turn a couple more sales in the meantime whereas if you're not getting paid in advance, that's cash you'd either have to raise from investors or you just can't deploy it back into your business. \n\nSo, giving the sales team an incentive to collect cash up front is very, very helpful. Another idea is bundling free services into an upfront payment. So the classic example would be like a software plus consulting service purchase. And if you can provide either discount on the people slash consulting time or effort or just giving that consulting time or effort away for free to incentivize cash up front, that can really work. Especially when it's a people-centric cost. I think a lot of customers realized that like software has a very low marginal cost but people time has a very high marginal cost. \n\nAnd so they know you're kind of throwing them a bone or taking a little pain or just giving them an extra good deal if you throw in some of those consulting services into the deal to get them to pay up front. So that's a really powerful lever as well. And then the fifth one is just doing an automatic auto-renew every year and collecting cash upfront on the auto-renew. Now you wanna be careful and respectful of your customers. You don't wanna surprise them. You wanna give them plenty of notice, you know a month or two out that the arrangement will auto-renew and that the cash is collected up front. Like it was the first time they signed the deal but just doing that auto-renew and doing an automatic collection, like attaching something to Stripe or Chargebee or something like that. \n\nAnd just being able to run the payment can actually be really, really helpful to your business. And you know, the customer oftentimes doesn't mind that because that's less headache. That's less things they're having to think about. As long as they signed up for the auto-renew in the first place, it's a totally kosher, cool thing to do. So I hope that helps. Again, collecting cash upfront for your business can be really powerful. You can re-deploy that cash into the business. It means that you will have to raise less capital from investors and you can actually grow a lot faster. \n\nSo I hope these tips help.

      "title": "What Happens If Your Startup Doesn't Make Its Medical Payments?",
      "description": "What Happens If Your Startup Doesn't Make Its Medical Payments?\n\nLooking for advice setting up your startup’s HR, finance, and payroll infrastructure? Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm talking about what do you do when your startup didn't make its medical benefits payments? \n\nThis is a humongous deal. It's a shame really, and it happens maybe once every couple years in the Kruze client base because a lot of times it's confusing for founders, especially if it's like the first company they've run. And they think that the payroll provider who, you know, you kind of get your benefits through the payroll provider most of the time, they think the payroll provider is gonna make those payments. And so we message this quite a bit during onboarding in that you actually have to set up a direct ACH debit with your medical benefits provider like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Kaiser, whoever you're using. \n\nBut sometimes founders just don't do it, so what do you do? Well, first, let's talk about the downside. This is actually really important because one of the core things you need as a successful company is for the employee base to have confidence in the company. And so if the employees find out that they're not covered because the company didn't make the medical benefits payment, maybe they're in the emergency room or something like that, that can really rock the company culture. It's really, really, it's toxic. So be really careful and make sure these payments are made. I know at Kruze, we try to point out if we ever don't see these payments made on a monthly basis 'cause we want the founder to be aware of this kind of stuff. \n\nBut there's some other things that can happen. You as a company potentially could be liable for all the medical bills, and even worse, the officers of the company, the executives and the board of directors, they can be personally liable. Not for sure, but there definitely a high likelihood of a lawsuit if the company doesn't step up and make all those payments on behalf of the employee. So just really critically important that you take care of this stuff. I know as a founder, there's a million things you gotta take care of, but making that, setting up that automatic debit ACH to the medical benefit insurance companies is really, really critical. \n\nNow, if you find out you haven't been doing it, especially if it's been a month or two, super easy fix. Call the benefits provider and get on the phone with them and they will actually usually reinstate you pretty quickly. Again, it's something that happens a decent amount and so they have a whole get up-to-date and get true in your account process. Now, if it's been three or four months or six months, this is a real issue. You may actually have to re-enroll. It's gonna take some real fancy footwork. I highly recommend having an HR professional who's super up-to-date and really has some friendly relationships they can call upon at the insurance companies. Someone who's kinda been there and done it like a thousand times kinda person. \n\nSo if that happens and you need help, shoot us an email. We're happy to connect you to some people who can get it fixed and make sure your employees are covered. And again, this is just the kind of thing that, it's confusing for everyone. The payroll providers are not on the hook for this. They do not make those payments for you. Your company needs to do it. And if it goes wrong, act quickly, fix it because really the executive team and the company can be held liable. So be careful and hope this helps, thanks.",

      "title": "How to Rebalance Ownership Between Founders",
      "description": "How to Rebalance Ownership Between Founders\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nFirst of all, why do this? Well, oftentimes like a company gets going maybe it's a solo founder, maybe there's two founders and the company's going for a little bit and then Miss Amazing or Mr. Amazing walks into the picture with a key skillset or connections or whatever that would make the company so much better and so you're tempted or you want to add someone to your founding team even though the company kind of got going already and so you need to kind of balance out the founder stock, right? Another situation could be their is two founders and they split it evenly at first but one is kind of over the course of time everyone kind of realizes that one is significantly stronger than the other or has more valuable expertise and so you kind of re-cut the pie, so to speak. \n\nSo that's why you would rebalance the ownership positions of founders. Now there's a couple different mechanisms you can try. I'll go over those and then I'm also going to give you a couple points to just be careful of. So the first and probably the easiest mechanism is to issue stock options to the new founder. This is easiest and best if the company's been kind of operating for a while and the beauty of stock options is there's a strike price established by the 409A Valuation. \n\nIn the early days is still pretty low and because that valuation is low it's still very appetizing for the founder. Of course, it's going to be a higher valuation than what the original founders or the original cut was because at that point, when the company was started there was like nothing there and so when the company is founded and the founders do their 83(b) and buy the stock, the founder stock, they usually we're talking like tens of pennies or one hundreds of pennies per share of stock. \n\nBut as soon as the company starts making progress or is about to raise money or does raise money you need to do a 409A Valuation to establish the fair market price of the stock and so the options are based on that but the nice thing about the options is that if they're issued at fair market value then there's nothing taxable at that moment. It's not a taxable transaction for whoever is getting that stock and so there's no like cash out of pocket in that transaction, which for these super early stage companies you just never know. A lot of people don't want to write like a 50 or $100,000 check super early, if they can kind of wait the other options. \n\nNow, if they chose to exercise those options and start the long term capital gains process, yes, there would be cash out of the pocket. They'd actually have to write the company a check to cover that option exercise. So, and we'll come back to that for a second on how to write that check and how to fund it but so that's options. Easy, very quick, non-taxable and the other option is to just issue more restricted stock or founder shares to this person that you want to beef up their ownership and that can work really well except restrictive stock often has like a vesting clock and you're actually getting the shares or not exercising to get the shares and so that restrictive stock is actually oftentimes taxable. \n\nSo the founder who's getting the extra shares and rebalancing upward is going to have a tax bill in that year for all the stuff that's vested. So that's kind of the negative to restricted stock and again, if you're doing this like two weeks after the founding of the company the restricted stock is going to be, you'll probably just use the par value, but two months, six months, a year after the company and there's significant progress made. That restricted stock's going to be pretty valuable and it's going to be a pretty big tax bill. So those are the two main mechanisms. Now, in terms of funding that option exercise. Sometimes we see companies grant a loan to the founder and the founder takes that money and then actually buys shares, exercise the options. And that can work except you just got to be wary of if the company goes down and that loan is forgiven. The forgiven piece of that loan becomes taxable income for the person who had the loan forgiven. \n\nSo like anytime a loan is forgiven in the real world that's taxable income. That's how the IRS sees it. So the person could end up paying taxes on a loan that was for stock that went to zero, right? So you got to be really, really careful with any kind of loan at the startup level. You would only really want to do that at a later stage moment when you're very, very sure the company's not going to go down. The other kind of mechanism or approach we see people do, which I want to highlight, which can be potentially dangerous. Is the company buys some shares back from one of the founders and then reissues those shares to another one of the founders.",

      "title": "Is it better for startups to pay vendors via credit card or check?",
      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're talking about a startup question, is it better for startups to pay a vendor via a check or credit card? Now, for the startup, it's always easier to pay via credit card. \n\nIt's super convenient. You give them the number, they run the transaction. And if you use Brex, like what we like and we put companies on, then it integrates into QuickBooks super easy. And it's very easy for us, your accountant, to characterize the transaction. It actually does it automatically most the time because of our proprietary software. So we love it when startups pay via credit card. \n\nNow there's a lot of times where vendors, the person you're working with, doesn't want to accept credit card. And the reason why is... Credit cards have a pretty hefty fee. Usually it's about 3%, 2.5%, 3%. And they don't want to pay that. I don't blame them because that's a lot of money. It's a lot of margin to lose. So they want to be paid via check. \n\nNow, for us, the accountant, the worst solution is for you to actually write a check to that vendor. The reason why is we use Plaid to pull down tons of data from bank counts and integrate into our proprietary systems. And we do not get check images from Plaid. It doesn't have them. So we have to manually go into your bank accounts. Click the check image once the check is cashed and look and see who you wrote in your chicken scratch to on that check. So that is not a great solution for us, your accountant. But luckily there's something called Bill.com which is out there. And Bill.com does all this electronically and it's super easy to pay vendors via a check or it's more like an ACH, like a direct payment because Bill.com has a payment network where it connects to your vendors, gets their bank account on the other side and actually just does like a direct deposit into their bank account. \n\nAnd guess what? We don't have to log into your bank account and read your little chicken scratch on the image. Even better, Bill.com allows you to upload the invoice into Bill.com, which syncs into QuickBooks and matches the payment when that actually goes out. So the real question you should be asking as a startup is should I pay vendors via credit card or Bill.com because Bill.com is a superior solution to just writing a check. And in that situation we're pretty agnostic. But I do think credit cards are a little bit easier for people. \n\nSo I would always lean towards the credit cards. But of course, if your vendor is not accepting the credit card because that fee most likely, then go ahead and just use Bill.com. We put all of our clients on Bill.com. It's super easy to use and you'll have a invoice record. You'll be able to pay your vendor electronically and your accounts will be very happy with you. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "What does an Outside General Counsel do?\n\nLooking for advice setting up your startup’s HR, finance, and payroll infrastructure? Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health\n\nI've been getting this question a lot more these days. I think most startup founder's executive teams are used to working with a big startup law firm to handle all their financings, the M&A for sure, but kind of lost in the shuffle a little bit is another service that law firms can provide which is just general counsel work and so I thought it would be interesting to take a second and I think oftentimes the outside or outsource general counsel firms typically are not like the huge big startup law firms that are handling your fundraising, that charge, you know at least a thousand dollars an hour kind of place.\n\nWe're like an outside accounting firm for tons of startups but because you're working with the companies for so many years and you know all their processes, oftentimes you built their processes, you really can do this in a very effective and efficient cost and lower cost way than hiring a full-time general counsel. \n\nSo before, if I was a startup before I hired a full-time general counsel, I'd actually work with one of these outsourced or outside general counsel services and so, so some of the things they cover, you know contracts like customer contract, vendor contracts that's actually really, really helpful to have a legal experienced person be able to roll through those and make sure you don't sign a bad contract. They are working with a lot of different companies so they see kind of what's what's market, what companies should be signing up for and what not and so you can actually just ... Just this, just by not signing one bad contract per year you could effectively pay for the general, outside general counsel service, but just, there's a lot of stuff in there and also allows you to close deals a lot faster rather than, you know, either you, the founder, trying to, you know, pretend like you're a legal scholar and reading these contracts, which, you know you're going to put off and take a week to do or sending it to one of the big law firms and they're going to charge you a ton of money and make it a low priority 'cause they're focused on fundraising and M&A. So you can close deals a lot faster by having this service alongside of you. The other thing that ... Licensing agreements are very similar. \n\nLike if you're going to license your technology or in-license something, you really want to have someone read through this and really be paying attention and again, continuity is really important. The fact that they know your business, work with your business all the time, they know kind of those edge cases that you really need to worry about if you're signing a contract. Some other things, you know, around IP protection, like a lot of startups for even though they're building really cool intellectual property will kind of drag their feet or not protect their IP through patents or other types of mechanisms like copyright trademark. \n\nThat's why people hire the big outside firms but really, you know, practically speaking, the outside general counsel can close those deals for you and also guide you through M&A, which is pretty exciting 'cause again, they know the company. And then there's a whole other component of compliance around board meetings, board resolutions, board minutes, documenting all the consents. That stuff is actually really important. You want to have a paper trail for everything discussed at your board meeting, 409A evaluations, stock option issuance, key decisions, documenting that the board has approved the financial plan for the year. \n\nIt's actually a really helpful service. We have a firm that we work with that we love that does this for us, and they, over time, they just become part of your team and it's really powerful and you know, it also as a founder, you don't have to be the only one to interface with them as your team builds trust and as you build trust with this lawyer, you can actually start having, you know, your executive team reach out to them and guess what? That takes you out of a bottleneck position. It helps you get business done quicker. \n\nAlso lightens your load a little bit and really that continuity and institutional knowledge is just so valuable to have in a lawyer on your side. So I hope this helps. Check out the, you know ... There's a bunch of outside general counsel services out there, and if you need some recs, just hit us up: kruzeconsulting.com. Thanks!",

      "description": "Startup trend: Replacing expense reports with credit cards\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about why startups are using corporate credit cards instead of expense reports. \n\nAnd this is really a trend we've been seeing happening for a while. And, you know, it's one of those things where the convenience of the corporate credit card, especially the virtual cards, how you can spin them up really, really quickly is making it, so like, there's just a lot less transactions that need to go through an expense report. And so the use case we're seeing nowadays quite often is a company will sign up with a corporate credit card company and create virtual cards for their employees. And those cards will typically have a low limit. That's kind of one of the expense control/fraud controls that the companies are doing and we're encouraging them. So that way, you know, if someone abuses the credit card, it's not gonna be a huge mistake. And so it's just a little bit easier. \n\nNow there's some negatives with this, right? Like, you know, expense reports do have kind of a high degree of oversight. Like someone's actually checking the expense report, approving it, but that takes time. That's not as convenient. So there's this time convenience trade-off with, you know, oversight/fraud prevention that you're trading off by going with corporate credit cards. But generally speaking, we see this happening quite a bit. The other benefits are like, the employee doesn't have to wait for the reimbursement to hit their bank account, you know. Sometimes it takes like two or three weeks to get that expense report approved and then the money's got to be moved from the company's bank account to the employee's bank account. That disappears. There's no reimbursement needed. Which is kind of nice. \n\nAlso, like I'm sure, you know, anyone listening to this has probably lost some receipts over the years or forgot to do expense reports. And that doesn't really happen with the corporate credit card anymore. So like sometimes like the employees are kind of like taking one for the team or losing some money by having to do expense reports and so they're avoiding that. One area we really do recommend expense reports is, when a founder has been paying for things out of their own pocket, their own personal credit card, usually before the company's raised money or, you know, before they have like a real business bank. That is something they should definitely file an expense report on, document that, get that on the balance sheet, get those in the income statement at the very least, even if you're not going to get paid back right away or reimbursed right away, at least that's on the balance sheet as a loan from the founder and you can get reimbursed when you raise more money down the road, but not doing an expense report there, means there's no documentation. \n\nThe IRS's favorite thing to audit is transactions or money going back and forth between the founder and the company. So you just, you know, it's an audit risk, a huge audit risk. So I hope that helps. I mean, I guess the other benefit of doing the corporate credit cards versus the expense reports is a lot of the expense report software requires a subscription anywhere from like 8 to 16 bucks a month. And so you're avoiding that extra cost if you're just using the corporate credit cards. That being said, some corporate credit card platforms do charge a monthly fee, but most of them are free because they're making money on the interchange. \n\nThey're basically making, whenever you buy something with a credit card, the issuing bank, and some of the other people in the chain actually make some money on interchange. And so that's the business model for a lot of the software is actually just making money on interchange. So I hope that helps. It's a pretty exciting place right now. We have Brex and Ramp growing really, really fast. Expensify has their virtual credit card. Now bill.com bought Divvy, because they know they need the credit card functionality. \n\nAirbase has come out and they're integrating with a lot of the big banks and big bank credit cards. So tons of activity in the space, but the core trend that we're highlighting here is just like people are just doing expense reports a lot less and they're relying on the corporate credit card to take care of that for them. \n\nHope that helps if you have any questions or comments hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com and we'll be there for you, thanks.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nRaising venture debt? Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott, from Kruze Consulting, and today we're doing a venture debt scouting report on Bridge Bank. Now Bridge Bank has been a venture lender for a long time, but they used to be a much smaller bank. Recently they were acquired by a large bank, so their balance sheet is really big so they can do much bigger deals. They're very aggressive and definitely someone you want to talk to. Our representatives on the West Coast is Mike. Mike’s been around venture debt for a very long time, he's a great guy, and easy to work with so I definitely recommended talking to Mike. In terms of things you should think about, pros and cons for Bridge Bank. You know they have the same low cost of capital that most banks offer. They also do low warrant coverage. So it's a very affordable, easy to work with a solution. The one negative is typically they'll use a MAC clause or investor abandonment as part of the deal. Sometimes covenants as well. But you're usually gonna get that when you're doing a bank term sheet, so there's nothing abnormal. It's not a knockoff Bridge Bank, that's just how banks lend money to startups. So again, great team. We really like working with Mike. They've been around for a very long time. They have a much bigger balance sheet now. They're very affordable, with low warrant coverage and low-interest rates. And again, you do have to keep in mind the Material Adverse Change clause or investor abandonment, if that's in the deal. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "When should your startup make its first operations hire?\n\nLooking for advice setting up your startup’s HR, finance, and payroll infrastructure? Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health\n\nI vote for somewhere around employee number eight to ten. And I like to call this person, the Jack or Jill of all trades. So they should be able to do a lot of different things. They're typically not like a VP of operations type of person. This is typically someone with like, you know, three to five years experience in the working world. Who's hungry, willing to do a lot of different things, can think on their feet. And doesn't have a huge ego. The ego stuff's kind of important. I was talking to one of my friends and she pointed out like this person is not always well-liked, when they join the startup. \n\nBecause even by like employee 10, there's a lot of bad habits that have happened inside of a startup. There's maybe the, you know, the financial infrastructure isn't great. Unless you're working with Kruze, of course. The operations or sales ops is not very good. There might be some facility problems. There might be like recruiting. It might be the company's been hiring their friends and not actually running like a real recruiting process. There are tons of things that need to be put in place or professionalized by the first operations hire. \n\nSometimes this person is called like a Chief of Staff. Sometimes they're called an Admin. I prefer to call them like an Ops person. Whatever the title is, they're gonna have to do a lot of things. And the person who typically actually, you know, the founders at most early stage startups control the purse strings and, and kind of ironically, a lot of them are the slowest to hire or slowest to see that they should hire this operations person. \n\nBut they're the ones who benefit the most. Because as a founder, you kind of start off as a one or two person team. You're doing everything. And the whole life of the company, you are shedding jobs, tasks, and giving it to other people who are specialized along the way and who can do it better than you. And so, you know, most of the people that hire us, they start off. They're just the CEO or founder. And what I like or I notice is on the accounting finance side, when the company gets to about 10 people, the founder has a lot more responsibilities. They're communicating with investors, they're doing a ton of recruiting. They are implementing the systems. \n\nOftentimes they're a subject matter expert in the category they started the company in. Why else would someone fund them? They actually know what they're doing. And so they're spending a ton of time on product. And they start being less responsive across the board. And for us, as an accounting firm and tax firm, we need those, that feedback. We need the answers and we want to be there to answer your questions. And so we start seeing like a slow degradation in quality of feedback from the client or answers to the feedback. \n\nAnd that's why I love bringing this ops person at, you know, employee 10, say. Because they're gonna be the liaison with us, your accounting and tax firm as a startup. But they're also going to help on the recruiting front, quite a bit. Again, they're going to help you put in systems. Like, they may not be the person that puts in Salesforce or Pipedrive. But they're gonna be the point contact for the contractor who puts Salesforce in, right? There's a lot of like liaising in this position. And that might not sound sexy for someone who hasn't done it yet. \n\nBut it's a way to learn the guts and how a company runs. Like you will learn every single aspect of the company in this role. And I think it's one of the most important roles in the whole company. And you also become a standard bearer or conveyor of the corporate culture. And sometimes people think like, oh, 10 team members, like, our culture is still forming. Our culture won't be determined till we're like, a 50 person company. The culture is determined almost like day one by the founders. But the operations person is someone that other team members, those other 10, 15, 20 in the early days, people who are not the founders can go to, to get resources, get something done, communicate with a founder if needed. They are a major part of your company culture. \n\nIt will help you as a founder, take things off your plate, be more effective. You will accelerate in product. You'll accelerate in recruiting. Your financials will be so much stronger. Your board will be so much happier. It will be easier to raise money the next time around. There's a ton of benefits that maybe aren't as quantitative as you might think, but they're definitely qualitative.",

      "description": "What is an Orphaned VC Deal?\n\nRaising venture capital? Get the finance and accounting due diligence checklist: https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-capital-finance-tax-hr-due-diligence-checklist\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm talking about orphaned VC deals. \n\nAnd I don't really like the term, I don't like that term, orphaned, it's not a positive term but this is what people call it so I figured I would make the video and we can all kind of agree that we need to come up with a better term for these types of deals. So essentially what it means is, the general partner, at the VC fund that led the investment into your startup has left their fund. And they are no longer, likely no longer on the board. \n\nBut even more important, likely no longer an advocate inside the fund for your company. And so this puts you the startup founder, in a very awkward position because you're gonna get assigned a new partner at that fund. But deep down inside that new partner knows that they are not the ones who originated this deal and if things go great for your company, there's a little bit of self-interest here at work in that they know that they're not gonna get a ton of credit. \n\nAnd so what typically happens is, it's kind of sad but companies that have, that lose their partner, typically have a much harder time getting follow-on capital inside the partnership, getting those endorsements and really just kind of generally get less of the funds time. Now of course, there's exceptions to this. Like I think Square, the Khosla investment in Square the partner ended up leaving and they did fabulously well. So it's not like your company's gonna die right away or anything like that. You just need to know as a founder, that it's gonna be a little bit tougher and that extra money or the benefit of the doubt you may not get. \n\nAnd so this is important to know going into this because you wanna pick someone who's gonna be at the fund for the long haul. One of my most fun cheats on this is just figure out who owns the management company of the fund. The management company manages multiple funds at whatever firm. And typically there's a couple partners that own the management company. Everyone else is an employee of the management company and the fund. And so the people who own the management company, they are not going anywhere. It's very difficult to get rid of them. \n\nSo it's really dangerous if you, a couple things, maybe you've got a partner who's just not doing great in their investments and the fund is getting ready to raise another fund and they asked that partner to step away. Also, another risk for you is maybe your partner is so good but they're junior and they're gonna leave to start their own fund. And so that means, probably you're helping them do that. You're part of their track record. \n\nBut when that partner leaves, it's just gonna be life's gonna be a little bit more difficult for you inside. And so I think I recorded this because I really want founders to understand this dynamic. Choose wisely. It's really tough these days, because we're seeing fundraising rounds happen in the matter of weeks. Like it used to be a month or two months. \n\nNow it's like two weeks and people are signing term sheets. And especially with COVID, you don't have as much of a chance to get to know people, on a one-on-one basis and really figure out what makes them tick, how happy they are at their firm, what the rest of their portfolio looks like. \n\nAnd so really, founders, do diligence on the partners you're gonna be working with, ask them what their long-term plans are. Maybe kind of do a little back channel and figure out who controls the purses at the fund. That'll tell you a lot about your working relationship. And again, if your partner does leave and you are an orphaned deal, it's not the end of the world but you're just gonna have to work a little bit harder. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "How to Handle a Co-Founder Departure\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nI guess there are two differences. First of all, there's the amicable. And then there's the termination, this person needs to leave immediately kind of thing. So when it's amicable, definitely a lot easier and the person in the company that is leaving will work with you and ideally work with the board to make it a smooth transition. \n\nIf it's a termination, then you know, you need to move fast. You need to do the typical stuff, like prepare their final paycheck, consult HR, document why they're being terminated, have the meeting with them. Definitely have a second person in that meeting so there's always two people. And you know, there's some other stuff we'll talk about, but that's the big stuff. Document everything, run their final paycheck, pay them for PTO, everything like that. Now in an amicable or maybe a full-fleshed way of talking about this, the other things you really want to think about are, first, how you're going to message this to the team. Because everyone that works at the company's committed to building the vision of these co-founders. \n\nThe next thing you want to do is work out the equity. And most co-founders are on a four-year vest for founder's share. So very similar to stock options. VCs typically require a four-year vesting period. And it usually has a one-year cliff and then vest after that, after the one-year cliff, you vest the first year or first quarter of the founder stock package. And then you start vesting monthly after that. So if the founder's leaving and it's still very early in the company's life, odds are, they probably haven't eclipsed that one-year vest yet. And so you're not really having to part with any equity. So that's always good. If the founder has been there for a while and has passed that one-year cliff and has vested on a monthly basis, odds are, they own a decent amount of stock. And so obviously, the company is going to retain everything that wasn't vested, but in an effort to retain some of the stock that was vested, oftentimes the board, if it's a really promising company, will actually offer to buy some of that stock back or all the stock back. \n\nAnd sometimes the founder, the co-founder who's leaving likes to do that because they clearly don't believe in the vision or they're burned out, or it's a nice cash windfall for them and they could go on and do their next thing or maybe even fund their next thing. So I've seen that happen quite a bit. And sometimes for the board, especially if it's not like the key person, but maybe like the second person or third person who's a co-founder, but not critically important to the company, it can be opportunistic for the VCs, because they can you know, if the person is leaving anyways, they can buy some of that stock back. And ideally, the company goes on to bigger and greater things. So that's something that actually happens quite a bit. The other things you want to make sure you do is make sure you have an IP assignment clause, especially when it's an early stage company. \n\nIf it's a later stage company or the founder has been there for a while, that's for sure going to be in place. I'm really talking about the super early stage companies where maybe the co-founder has been working there for six months, isn't passionate and is leaving, that IP assignment is critical. Because if the company doesn't own the IP that the co-founder has created, then there could be litigation down the road. So very, very important to sign that. Typically, not always, but sometimes you'll do a severance or something like that, where you'll make the landing a little softer for the co-founder who's leaving. In exchange for that, you typically ask for non-disclosure agreements and language that basically says the company can't be litigated in exchange for that cash payment. \n\nTypically in kind of a legal world, if someone's signing over rights, like their willingness not to sue and things like that down the road, they do need to receive compensation for that to be kind of a contract in the law's eyes. So paying that severance and getting those signatures on the non-disclosure and no litigation stuff is actually really helpful. And then I also talked about making sure you pay vacation, any reimbursements, that's just good practice for any employee who's leaving. But make sure you do that on the last day.",

And today I'm answering the question, \"How much flexibility does a startup's board have in setting the strike price for options?\" And this is a question I get quite frequently, actually, \n\nso I thought I'd just make a video here. So the short answer is, the board has very little flexibility. So let me explain why. First of all, boards should be very wary of incurring liability or underpricing stock options only to have to reverse those pricing later on when the company's successful and goes through an audit. If a company under-prices their options and the auditors figure that out later, there's going to be what's called cheap stock charges, so like, actually hits to your profit and loss statement. Now, they're non-cash, but they do show up on the profit and loss statement. You often see this with like, companies that are doing an IPO. But you want to try to avoid it if possible. \n\nSo you really want to stick with what the independent valuation provider gives you for the exercise price and that is known as a 409A evaluation. And the reason why the board has to worry about liability here is, the IRS actually instituted 409A valuations, a while back, probably like, I think it's probably been like 15 years, maybe 17 years. I remember when I was working in venture capital, everyone was up in arms about this because it was expensive to do, and everyone had just been kind of used to pricing every share at a penny and calling it a day. \n\nBut what the IRS figured out is like the boards were systematically under pricing stock options. And an example for this is, say they price at a penny a share instead of whatever the fair market value might be like a dollar a share. And so when it's a penny share all the management team, they all exercise, pay the penny a share for all their shares, and then they own it at that point. And then every incremental increase in value is taxed at the capital gains tax rate which is usually around kind of, it depends and vacillates but it's like 20% is good proxy for that. Whereas like the ordinary income tax can be all the way up to like 35, 40%, right? And so there's a huge tax difference if you exercise early and treat everything as capital gains. \n\nSo that's what everyone in the startup community was doing. And the IRS figured out that was costing them and the treasury quite a bit of money in tax revenue. And so they instituted the 409A requirement and they require it to be done by an accredited valuation provider. So your board can't just pretend to be a valuation firm that has accreditations and just price it. So you have to use a third party. It's actually really easy to do, the price has come down quite a bit. So I highly recommend doing that. So it's best just to be safe, avoid liability avoid cheap stock charges later on and don't mess around. Don't like, get the 409A price and then haircut it by 20%. You can't do that. You need the documentation. You need to be able to show that to the IRS that you actually have that independent third party. \n\nSo be safe, be conservative, it'll pay off in the long run. So I hope that helps. And if you have any other questions on this hit us up at the Kruze Consulting 409A Valuation page. We have a pretty nice little page there with videos and explainers and I'm sure this video will land on that page at some point so check us out. Lots of good information there and on other stuff like accounting and taxes for startups. Thanks so much.",

      "description": "In this video, you'll learn about how Bessemer Venture Partners established the Bessemer Cloud Index in 2013 to monitor the success of newly listed public firms that are primarily engaged in offering cloud software to their clients.\n\n***********************************\nAdditional Resources\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA7ma7S9tdI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7uDAHurSik\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF-FcmvUyM0\n\n***********************************\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes?

And today I'm answering the question, what is the Bessemer Cloud Index? \n\nWell, this is one of the newer, cooler, stock market indexes, and big shout out to Bessemer Venture Partners who put this together. It's been a while. I think this has been going for like five or six years. But they are one of the early investors in cloud, SaaS companies. And they were very smart. They're like, \"Hey, we believe in these kind of companies. Let's create an index to track the performance,\" and it becomes kind of this cool, self-fulfilling prophecy where every SaaS founder knows or wants to be in this index eventually when they're publicly traded. And so, hey, it's a good thing to do to talk to Bessemer and get them involved in your company, too. So great marketing, great job, Bessemer, for getting ahead on this. And I love the index. There's actually a really good website, cloudindex.bvp.com because they have really amazing charts. They show you all the companies that make up the index. They show the performance. \n\nAnd maybe most importantly for investors and people in the startup world, they show stats like forward revenue multiple. And a revenue multiple is basically like the value public market investors are paying for every dollar of revenue. So if you have $100 million in revenue and you have a 10x multiple, well, guess what, you're a billion dollar valuation. That's how the math works. And so I think one of the reasons I wanted to do a video on the cloud index was just so that people knew there is a pure-play way to look at SaaS company performance. And frankly, it's been a little ugly the last six months. The SaaS companies had a huge run up with COVID and the index reflects that performance. And over the last six months, it's down about 40%. So there's been a lot of pain in SaaS, but this is historically a pretty volatile subsector. \n\nWhen you compare like the SaaS performance down 40%, or the cloud index performance down 40% to NASDAQ. NASDAQ's only down 15% because there's a lot of really large companies, cashflow positive, very mature tech and growth companies in the NASDAQ. So this is a better pure-play measurement stick for the startup SaaS ecosystem. And that's why I pointed it out. So by the way, you can actually buy the Bessemer Cloud Index. You can buy an index and actually have it in your portfolio. There's a couple different tickers. EMCLOUD or WCLD are two ways to buy this. And so I actually own a little bit myself because it's a great way to get broad exposure across all the SaaS companies. \n\nSo if you're a startup in the SaaS space, in the cloud space, and you're trying to figure out, what's the market like, what are the revenue multiples like, then this is a really great tool, because at the end of the day, venture capitalists are investing in companies in the early stages and in medium stages so that they can become late-stage startups, so they become IPOs and get publicly traded. So venture capitalists are always watching the performance in the equity markets to see how comparable companies are trading and what they're doing. \n\nAnd so if you're early stage and medium stage founder, always pays to keep your eye on the Bessemer Cloud Index. Hope that helps. If you have any questions on stock multiples or the SaaS market, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com. Thanks.",

Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHi guys, I'm Vanessa Kruze and today I just wanted to go over with you guys a 2017 recap, as well as go over some things that are coming up for 2018. First things first, thank you so much for being with us for 2017. We're looking forward to a great 2018, and we have absolutely loved and enjoyed working with you, so we're super-excited to see what 2018 brings. There are really five things that I wanted to go over with you guys before 2017 closes and 2018 comes up before we know it. The first thing to keep an eye out for is the tax compliance calendars. This is one of the most requested pieces of information that we get from our clients. It's all the tax deadlines that you need to consider for 2018. First deadline of which, of course, is the 1099s W2s and 3921s, which are coming up on January 31st. So those calendars should be available to you any moment now. The second thing that you want to take into consideration is R&D Tax Credits. This is real. This is super important. Many of our clients got back checks for 10,000, 50,000, even $250,000 from the IRS that they've been able to deposit into their bank account. It is real. It's a big deal. If you haven't done an R&D Tax Credit with us yet, or if you want to do anyone one for 2017, be absolutely sure to check in with me or your account manager. The third thing that we wanted to go over with you guys is all of the content that we've published throughout 2017. We've been hard at work doing videos like this as well as the podcast, Founders and Friends with Scott Orn, definitely check that out and some of the blog posts and Q&A that we have on our website. Many different forms to get your knowledge fixed when it comes to accounting, finance, tax, and HR for startups. Fourth, I wanted to introduce to you, Stephen Yarbrough. He is a CPA he joined us about a month or two ago. He's an amazing guy. He comes to us with 10 years of experience from PWC, which a very prestigious accounting firm, and then eight years at the IRS, so he is extremely knowledgeable but more than that he's just an awesome guy. I think once you get on the phone with him you'll see that he's just absolutely magnetic and just a wonderful person to talk to. Last, but certainly not least, Scott and I are having a baby. We're expecting a little baby girl in January so we're super excited to make this new addition to our lives. So stay tuned and lots of good things to come for 2018. I'm Vanessa Kruze and check us out at kruzeconsulting.com. Thanks.",

And today I'm answering the question, how often should my startup have a board meeting? \n\nAnd this is a question we get quite a bit, because at Kruze we work with a lot of like C, series A, series B companies, and they're always trying to figure out, am I spending the right amount of time with my board? Am I over-indexing there? Is it time well spent? And from my perspective, I'm personally a every six weeks to eight weeks kind of person on board meetings. And you see some companies do it every four weeks but that's just like, the cycle is too fast. Like it's actually too hard to do board prep and have a substantial conversation because in a way not that much has changed every month. It is good to do a update email for your board every month. I highly recommend that as a way of keeping them engaged. \n\nBut for the board meetings, I recommend every six to eight weeks and you know you could probably err towards the eight weeks. So that basically means you're doing, kind of, six board meetings, maybe seven board meetings a year. But I think it's really important to keep your board involved. You know, like founders scrutinize the venture capital firms and the VC's they take money from on the front end when they're taking money from them. But it's really important to stay connected to those people. They are working for the company. They're a fiduciary, they've got a lot of capital at place and the more connected they are the more likely they are to help the company and more likely to be there for the founder when things get tough. Like, startups are tough, bad things happen. It's a rocky road out there. Even the best companies have tough times. \n\nAnd so you really want your venture capital investors and board members to be behind you. And if they are getting frequent updates, know exactly the issues in the business, they can be there in those tough times. You can also use them opportunistically for positive things even when times aren't tough. Like helping you reel in that big final recruit that you're trying to get to complete your management team. Venture capitalists are great sales people. That's a key skill in that job. And so they're good at recruiting and they do that for their other portfolio companies. So they should be doing it for you. \n\nAnother thing you can use them for is just the quick check in of like, am I a fundable company right now? As in, if I needed to raise capital right now do we have enough progress. Either revenue, customers, technology progress to be able to raise our next round. That's very helpful information for the management team. And remember, the venture capitalists are in the market all day long. They're talking to new companies all day long sourcing deals. So they have a very good pulse on the milestones required for a series A or a series B or even a series C and they will be able to give you direct feedback. \n\nAnd if there's a high degree of trust and you're very aligned they will give you very honest and direct feedback. So those are kind of two of the main reasons I love having consistent board meetings. Another kind of maybe reason that people don't always think about but it's a really great way to help develop the management team at a company. Because the executive team actually gets to, and this isn't every company, but I recommend it, letting the executive team report directly to the board for like a 15 minute segment in each board meeting. That way that executive team member actually preps their own update. They're thinking very closely about it. They're thinking about what they promised last time. \n\nAnd so there becomes this additional level of scrutiny but also opportunity for those executives. They can sharpen their presentation skills, know what's important to the venture capitalist, pick up some nuggets in that part of the conversation. So it's also just a great development opportunity for the startup management team and really that's what it's all about. Like the stronger the management team the better shot the company has of being successful.",

      "description": "What is an employer of record?\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze consulting. And today we're talking about a term, \"employer of record\", That is really important in startup world right now, specifically because PEO's which are Professional Employer Organizations are becoming much, much more popular, mostly because of COVID with employees, you know, a lot of companies are finding their employees are moving throughout the country, even world, really, and that is necessitating a different approach to payroll and benefits and all that kind of stuff. \n\nSo the employer of record is kind of self-evident, but basically the employees of the company are in a legal way working for the employer of record, which is a PEO in the case I'm talking about. So like TriNet, Justworks, Rippling has a PEO, ADP has a PEO. You think they're working for the startup, but they're actually contractually legally working for that PEO. \n\nAnd the reason this is, this exists is because the PEO can then pool employees across many different organizations after all, they are the employer of record, and negotiate better health benefits, perks, all that kind of stuff. And so that's why the employer, I keep saying employee, that's why the employer of record is so important. \n\nYou just want to kind of know that, you know, if you are a company that uses TriNet, the W2 that the employee gets at the end of the year will actually be from TriNet, not your company. And this structure and legal contractual approach is what unlocked, you know, a lot of the things in the PEO industry, it was really kind of a legal arbitrage that's been embraced, it works really well. \n\nTons of startups work with all those companies I mentioned. And again, their employer of record is actually the PEO firm, not the startup, but no big deal. Everyone's kind of used to it. And again, it's a way to maximize the amount of money or get the most bang for your buck on benefits. The PEO also helps with some of those state and local tax compliance. \n\nSo it's a good approach overall, and it's just become more popular with COVID. So hope that helps.

Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're answering the question, what is the minimum check size to get pro rata rights in an angel investment? \n\nAnd this is a question we actually get quite a bit. And usually, I mean, and sometimes, founders will just give everyone who participates in the early rounds pro rata rights. Now, that's super nice of them but I wouldn't really recommend that. Instead, what we see most of the time is that there is a threshold for something called a \"Major investor.\" And this is in the fundraising documents, and all major investors get pro rata rights going forward. \n\nNow, typically the threshold to become a major investor is $100,000 check size in angel seed deals. Now, it can be higher, it can be like 500K. It can be lower, it could be like 50K. But a $100,000 is typically the average, it's kind of what we see most of the time. \n\nNow you might be asking yourself, why do pro rata rights matter so much? Well, they actually matter because it allows you in the future if you have a really great company to keep putting more money in the company to protect your ownership position. So, say you own 1%, you're an angel investor, you own 1% in a great seed stage startup, and that becomes the next Uber or Facebook or something huge like that. Being able to protect your ownership and keep 1% of that company is incredibly valuable over time. \n\nInstead of being diluted down, you can just keep pumping money in and whether you need to beg or borrow or do whatever you need to get that check to invest in the next Facebook or Uber along the way, you're gonna do it. So that's why people care about pro rata rights so much. \n\nSo again, 100K is typically the threshold where founders and the other investors will let someone have pro rata rights in the future. Hope that helps, thanks!",

      "description": "Top tip to close a seed round\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today I'm sharing with you my number one top trick for closing your seed round. \n\nAnd guess what? It's as easy as using a convertible note, or SAFE note, and just changing the discount over time. And so what you want to do is start with a bigger discount to begin with, meaning the investors get a better deal if they put money in early, and you slowly move that discount down, which is more beneficial to the company. So there's a less of a discount, which means investors don't get as good of a deal. And so there's this massive incentive to invest early. \n\nYou can also do this with the valuation cap. The discount, typically it's kind of 15% to 20% of whatever the next round is, but the valuation cap often takes precedent in those situations when there's a big up round. You can start the valuation cap low, which means a lower valuation for the investors, and then move it up over time as more investors come in. \n\nThis really, really helps. It helps entice investors to put money in now or early, instead of waiting. I kind of, to borrow a basketball term, call it, \"hanging around the hoop,\" like waiting to see who comes around, right? You want them to take a stand. \n\nIf they love your company, they should be putting money in now, not waiting to see who else invests. And so this little trick actually will really help you close the round. Sometimes, managing investors is a little bit like herding cats. And if there's a monetary incentive to act early and act forcefully for investors, they will often take that. \n\nSo hope this little trick helps. Best of luck.

      "description": "How do VCs spend their time?\n\nRaising venture debt? Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt\n\nEveryone thinks VCs just get to run around and invest in tons of companies and have the greatest job of all time, but they only get to do that for a small, actually, a pretty small percent of their time, maybe 20, 30%. There's a lot of other stuff they have to do. And the first thing is they have to fundraise for their own funds. And so a lot of times entrepreneurs don't realize that VCs have a similar relationship that they have to their VCs. The venture capitalists are kind of beholden or need to make their limited partners happy. \n\nAnother thing you need to do which is probably maybe the bulk of the time is working with your portfolio companies. This is really what the best VC funds do, and the best partners. So of course you've got your board meetings every four to six weeks, sometimes every two months, but plan on doing a sizeable amount of board meetings with the company that you invested in. And there was a lot of prep before that board meeting. You're going to get the board packet a couple of days early. You're going to read through that and think about the questions. Sometimes there's like sub-committees like compensation committees, audit committees, things like that. \n\nAnother thing you're gonna need to do is review the financial plan and do approvals. That's super, super important especially in December and January, that's usually when most companies are getting their plan approved. It's a pretty hefty board meeting. It usually takes a while because everyone wants to talk through revenue projections, expense projections and really layer on the milestones where the company's going qualitatively with the quantitative financial plan. Of course, another thing that this segues into is financing plan. Basically, when are you gonna raise money? Are you gonna raise another round next year? Are you gonna do venture debt? Are you cash flow positive? Are there other alternative fundraising options you can do? So there's a lot going on there, but fundraising and making sure the financial plan is fully baked and incredible is super, super important. \n\nAnother thing that venture capitalists do is they do a lot of diligence calls on your company's behalf. When other VCs are gonna invest in your company, they wanna talk to the venture capitalists on the board. They wanna know the inside scoop. They wanna know what's going on. They wanna know how great is the entrepreneur. Are they really... Is the CEO really smart? Is she a great salesperson? Is she great quantitatively? Is she a great engineer? What makes that CEO special and their founders special? So there's a lot of diligence calls. They also do a lot of diligence calls the venture lenders as well. \n\nAnd then one of the final things kind of operationally they do for their portfolio companies is doing a lot of recruiting. Obviously, if you're gonna bring in like a VP level person or maybe a director level person, the venture capitalist is part of kind of wooing that person oftentimes, and also VC funds. A lot of them now have recruiting arms. So they'll actually do a lot of recruiting work for your company. Not necessarily the partner that's on the deal. They will do those diligence calls with potential hires that are especially big time people. But you can also leverage the VC firm's in-house recruiting team. That's actually a really great tool. So that's all the stuff they do for their portfolio companies. \n\nThe final bucket that venture capitalist do, spend their time on is a lot of networking, writing, press, videos, whatever is their kind of shtick. I think probably 10 years ago, venture capitalists figured out that content marketing worked for them, too. And so they would do Fred Wilson's blog or Bill Gurley's blog or Mark Suster would do Snapchat all the time when Snapchat first came out. But there's just a lot of information and content that venture capitalists put out to help communicate with the market, help teach entrepreneurs. \n\nThey also do a lot of press because they wanna... it's helpful to be in New York Times or CNBC. And so that's another aspect of their job. So we total all this up, you can see venture capitalists have a lot of responsibility. That's why they get the big bucks, but there's a lot of responsibility and a lot of time demands. And so, again, if you're an entrepreneur who's looking to talk to VCs and try to get in front of them and pitch them, a little bit of empathy will help because talking to you, potential entrepreneurs that they're gonna invest in is probably their favorite part of the whole job. And yet you can see they have all these responsibilities that make it a little bit difficult to allocate as much time as they want. \n\nSo be patient and have a little empathy for the VCs and it should get you somewhere. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're doing a venture debt report on City National Bank. A lot of people refer to them as CNB. They're a great group to work with. They're led by Rod Werner, who's the consummate Silicon Valley deal maker. Rod started at Comerica and built a really big practice at City National Bank through. He's been a great partner over the years, especially with Kruze Consulting clients. Now, City National will definitely bank early-stage companies, but they tend to lend to later-stage companies now. That's a shift they made about a year ago. They're very active, though. They can do really big deals, so if you're mid to late-stage company, you definitely want to talk to them. On the early side, it's worth talking to Rod because he just knows everybody and you never when they can do something there. Like most banks, City National has a low cost to capital, so the interest rate's very low, and they also don't ask for a lot of warrant coverage. It's really a very affordable option if you're doing venture debt. Now, also remember though the downside of banks, they typically use covenants and they typically use something like an investor abandonment clause, clause, so you just have to know that going in, negotiate around that, be careful, but a lot of people, especially the late-stage companies, love working with City National because they can do big deals, they're creative, and it's very affordable. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "How to payback COVID payroll tax deferrals\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nIf you remember, take yourself back to March, April 2020. The federal government was doing everything they possibly could to help startups, small businesses survive COVID, it was a very scary time, I know we were scared. And so one of the things they made available to startups and small businesses in general, is you could delay paying or defer your payroll tax payments. And so, pretty much any business that runs payroll is gonna pay payroll taxes, you should be paying payroll taxes to the government. \n\nAnd so the government, you know, they were doing the right thing, they were making more cash available to startups that needed it. But, when we kinda looked at it, it wasn't like a grant or a forgivable loan like PPP, that was kind of a pure cash injection, it was a loan, you were basically deferring these payroll taxes, but you had to pay them back. And the schedule to pay them back was 50%, that was deferred in 2020, needs to be paid back in 2021 by the end of the year. And the other 50% had to be paid back by the end of the year 2022. So, it's not bad, it was a loan, it was a zero-cost loan, not a bad thing to do. \n\nOur concern at Kruze was, what happens if, heaven forbid, but a startup goes out of business. They had actually done the payroll tax deferrals. And the IRS and the federal government wants their money and the company's gone out of business. And so we were pretty cautious on encouraging companies to do this, because we didn't want the government to come back after those founders' personal money if the company had crashed. So that's the context behind the payroll tax deferral. But, guess what, we are in 2021, it is time to start paying back these payroll tax deferral loans. And so a lot of companies have been asking us, how do you do it? And this isn't something handled by your payroll provider, that you did make the selection inside of your payroll provider dashboard, but, they want you to pay the federal government directly. \n\nAnd so the way you do that, there's a system called EFTPS, which is like an electronic funds transfer network that the federal government has. And so you're actually gonna use that to pay the federal government. Now remember, you only have to pay 50% of it back in 2021 and 50% in 2022. So you're gonna log in, create an account, and you're actually gonna start sending them money. Now, some companies prefer to do this on a monthly basis, right, so that's it's not all hitting at the end of 2021. But other companies are preferring to just wait 'til late in December and actually just make their 50% payment then. However you do it, it's a good best practice to establish your account and actually know how it works and be able to fund it. You don't wanna be the people trying to pay this on December 31st, and not be able to figure your account and then not get the money in, and then have a big penalty. \n\nSo you gotta be really careful about this. And so, just remember, you can actually pay it before it's due, so you don't have to wait until December, there's companies that we work with, not that many took this, but some of the ones that we did, they're just paying on a monthly basis. Also remember that the IRS is going to send you a statement every quarter for what you owe. And they kinda do it on a quarterly basis, like Q1 2020, Q2 2020. And so you may get actually four statements in the mail saying \"Hey.\" This is if you deferred for all four quarters in 2020, you may get four statements, so just know. Also remember that when you do make payments, the IRS is going to apply those payments to the earliest deferral. So for example, say you make a bunch of payments now, until you fully pay back the 2021 obligation every payment is gonna go against the 2021 obligation. \n\nSo, I just wanna make sure you kinda do the accounting in your head correctly, and you're not thinking you're paying back a portion of 2021, or 2020 evenly, it's all gonna go back to the 2020 allocation first, and then the 2021 obligation. So, I mean, those are the big mechanisms to do that. Remember you do need to establish an account at EFTPS.gov. You can't just like send a check to the IRS to do this, and again, your payroll provider will not make this payment for you. You need to do this, you need to go to that website, sign up, create an account, then follow their money transfer directions there.",

      "description": "Distributing advisor shares for your startup\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nIt makes sense because there's a lot of people in the world who will just help your company out without even asking for shares. And then there's the people who definitely deserve advisor shares because they're helping out a ton. And then on the other side of the spectrum are the people who almost like make a living out of either trying to get a little bit of advisor shares and doing very little work or over promising what they can actually do and asking for a ton of advisor shares. So there's some different use cases there. So let's go over that real quick. So obviously, you know, if you build a network, if you're a good citizen, if you help other people out, you can actually get a lot of help without actually giving out shares in your company. I do think it's nice if someone's going to be consistently involved and committed over a long period of time, basically as an advisor actually give them some shares. \n\nSo what I typically see is companies picking a few core advisors and giving out anything from like, you know, something like 25 basis points, which is 0.25% of the company. You might see them give out, do that for like three or four people. If there's someone out there who is like a just amazing mentor and has the connections, the Rolodex, the ability to make a round come together, you might give them something like 1% of the company. But you'd also want to vest that over four years and make sure they're continually working with the company. So not just like someone who's like almost like an investment banker, but someone who's a true advisor. Who's going to be a consigliere with the CEO for many, many years. Those are people that you're really kind of upping the ante. You're giving them like 1% of the company is a lot. So, you know, that's, they need to earn that. \n\nBut those are typically people who you know, you have a relationship with, you trust and they're not going to just disappear on you. The nightmare scenario, there's kind of two, which is the, hey, it's almost like visualize the getting off the bus in Hollywood, 20 years ago, wanting to be famous and not really knowing who to trust or who not to. When you're a new entrepreneur, like you don't know always who's going to be a good mentor, who's going to be a good advisor and you'll run into people who will say something like, \"Give me 5% of your company and I'll take care of all of the fundraising.\" \n\nAnd just have your, \"if it's too good to be true meter\" on and if it's too good to be true, it's probably not true meter should be going crazy at that moment when someone asks for a gigantic piece of your company and just says, \"I'll take care of everything, don't worry.\" Right, alarm bells should be going off. Beware of these people. Someone who is that well-connected and is asking for that much of the company, will just write you a check. They will actually invest in the company, right? They'll be greedy that way, not greedy on getting free shares. If it was really that easy and they could just snap their fingers and make a round come together, they would invest. \n\nThey would help lead the round, yada yada, yada. So beware of those people. I've actually been approached by those people in my past. Where they're professional salespeople and they're good at like, kind of going around the valley and getting a few newbies to sign up for that kind of stuff. So just be careful. The other area that I know, and this may conflict with what other people think. This is just me. But I also see entrepreneurs give out advisor shares to people who look great in a PowerPoint deck or a fundraising deck, but really aren't going to do much for the company. And they think that like, oh, I've got these names attached and maybe they'll get some sales for me or due diligence for a VC. It's a fallacy. \n\nLike if they're not engaged and they're not actually paying attention, I don't really believe in diluting yourself like that. I believe in, you know, say you're giving out a couple percent to 10 people and they're not actually, you can just kind of tell they're not really going to do anything, you're just putting them in the PowerPoint presentation. I would actually personally rather just sell 2% of equity, get the cash and hire a couple of people full time who are going to be really dedicated to the company. You see people, entrepreneurs, buying into like the, I've got superstars on my advisory board, even though everyone kind of knows they're not going to do a whole lot. It doesn't really help you that much. \n\nSo my core advice circling back is, be focused.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHi. It's Scott at Kruze Consulting. Today, we're talking about how do VC liquidation preferences actually work. For those who don't know, a liquidation preference gives a venture capitalist the right to get their money back before other shareholders. An example might be they might invest $5 million into a startup. That startup, when it gets sold, the VCs have a momentary decision where they can actually say I want my $5 million back, which means the investment effectively worked as a loan. They just got their capital back. Or they can convert and participate in all the upside along with the other shareholders. The liquidation preference is a great risk mitigation tool for VCs. When the company doesn't have a big exit but actually does generate some proceeds, it means the VCs get their money back, they haven't lost their capital, and they can live to play another day. Of course, if a company has a big exit, they convert and participate alongside everybody else. So it's a way of mitigating their downside while also preserving their upside. Liquidation preferences are found in almost every single deal a VC will do. Typically, they'll ask for 1x, one time their money. Sometimes when it's a real kind of tough situation or downside situation, they might ask for two or three times their money. That's pretty rare. Typically, you're going to see a 1x liquidation preference. Remember, what that does is that means the VCs can get their money back if the company has kind of a modest exit. On a big exit, they're always going to convert and play for the big upside. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "title": "What Is a Co-Employer Relationship and What Are The Benefits for Employees?",
      "description": "In this video, you'll learn what a co-employer relationship is and what the benefits are for employees.\n\nLooking for advice setting up your startup’s HR, finance, and payroll infrastructure? Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about co-employment relationships. \n\nAnd this is essentially what you're signing up for when your startup starts working with a PEO, professional employer organization. But essentially, the co-employer relationship means that you essentially both have responsibility over these employees. There is a division of responsibilities but you're basically signing a contractual agreement with the PEO that they're going to handle specific stuff for you. So, the advantage of this is, as a management team, you get to focus on your business. You don't have to worry as much about like state and local taxes, the PEO will also do a lot of benefit price negotiations for you, but you do pay a sizable fee for this. \n\nSo, there's some trade-offs here. It's important to note that the startup, the employer, is still responsible for managing the employees on a day-to-day basis. The PEO is not like going to do that for you, nor should, would you want them to out for you. But there's a pretty clear line of responsibility that you are in charge of, determining who you're going to hire at your startup, you're going to manage them on a day-to-day basis, that kind of stuff. So, the PEO goes about as far as you want it, because again, you do want to make those decisions for your company but it's not like a complete out, it's not like an abdication of responsibility, no matter how some people might position it. \n\nSo, the benefits are, you don't have to worry about HR as much, they will take some of the burden off of you, they will do a lot of your state and local tax filings but there can be some negatives, especially if the PEO is not certified by the IRS to submit taxes and do taxes correctly. A startup can actually get in pretty serious trouble if their PEO is not submitting the taxes properly. This is like a baseline function of a PEO but not all PEOs are certified by the IRS. In fact, I remember a couple years ago, there was a major PEO that we worked with at Kruze a lot who was going through this process. and because of that, the R&D tax credit stuff was dramatically delayed. Thankfully they were certified, made everything a lot easier. \n\nThey could submit all that stuff electronically and still be able to process all the tax credits and all that kind of stuff for the Kruze clients. So, just super, super important. This is actually like an official designation, certified PEO. So, if you're signing up with a PEO, you can either ask us and we'll tell you if they're certified or not, the big ones that we work with are all certified, or check their website, do some Google searches but just make sure if you're taking a chance on like a new PEO or a regional PEO that maybe the rest of the startup ecosystem doesn't work with, definitely make sure they are certified. You do not want to make that mistake. Say you pay your payroll taxes to the PEO and then the PEO does not relay those payroll taxes to the IRS or state agencies, your company is still responsible. \n\nSo, that would be a massive problem, a massive amount of money you have to pay twice and massive penalties. So, just be really, really careful about that. One other really nice thing about working with a certified PEO is that, you can leave that PEO anytime during the year. If it's not a certified PEO and you're still filing on their EIN number, there can be a lot of messiness with trying to switch to just a regular like payroll and benefits company. So, that's kind of, the certified PEO is not about just submitting all your taxes correctly and things like that, but they have a higher standard that they have to provide to give you an off-ramp off the service and make it easier for you to do electronically. \n\nSo, the co-employer relationship is very powerful, it's super helpful for a startup. We see a lot of startups doing that, over 35% of our startup clients at Kruze now use a PEO and a co-employer relationship. But important to know that you're working with a certified PEO and also know where the line stops, where you are still required to hire, manage, do all that kind of stuff for your employees. But they do provide a lot of additional support, which is nice. So that's it, that's it on PEOs.

      "description": "83B Election - What to file and when?\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question, what is an 83B election, and how do you do it? \n\nNow the 83B election is a form that you send into the IRS telling the IRS that you are electing to buy your stock immediately, even if it hasn't all vested yet. And you're locking in a low tax basis. Therefore, all appreciation after you've filed that 83B, and after you bought that stock, is gonna be taxed at a capital gains rate, which is something like 20%, give or take. And so that's a really nice place to be. \n\nIf your company IPOs someday, you're gonna have a really huge gain, and only having to pay capital gains tax is gonna be really nice for you. The alternative is forgetting to send in your 83B election form and having to pay income tax on the delta of appreciation every year as the stock vests. So if a stock goes up in value a ton after the first year or two, you're gonna have to pay income tax on that appreciation. And income tax rates are somewhere between 30 and 40%. \n\nSo there's a really big delta there. You're talking about a lot the money, especially if your company gets bought or IPOs. So please fill out that 83B election form, and also send it into the IRS with certified mail. I always tell people sometimes the IRS gets a lot of mail. It's easy for things to get lost. So make sure you have proof that you sent that in. And remember you only have 30 days to actually elect an 83B so do it right away. Like the day your company is incorporated. Fill out that form, that your lawyer will give you to do it, Mail it in, do the certified mail, and get it off your plate. \n\nSo you don't forget it. There're so many times where founders forget to do this. And it's really pretty much impossible to unwind. You're just not going to be able, to get that favorable tax treatment. So I highly recommend doing it right away. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "Top 8 Ways Employees Steal Money from a Startup\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nThe first one is cash advances. Never let people have cash advance access to the bank account. You'll see this like $200 or $300 at a time kind of thing. This is why having virtual cards and issuing people credit cards is the right way to do things, but occasionally we'll see someone who let an employee go to the bank and take money out. Like do not ever let that happen.  \n\nAnother one that's really scary is they put their own wire information in instead of the customer's wire information. This is wire fraud. This is a federal crime, but people do it. People do sketchy stuff. So you gotta be really, really careful. Sometimes, this is a bad one, they will collaborate with a vendor to overbill a company and then take a kickback on the backend in cash. Super important, this is why you need to look at all the invoices you're paying, approve everything, have a second set of people approving invoices so that person can't just jack up an invoice and then take a kickback on the back end. Another, I wouldn't say favorite, just something we see, this is one of the more often ones is an employee paying their personal credit card with the company's funds. This is something we see quite a bit in very early stage companies. I'd say like one in one in 50, one in 70 companies, something like that. \n\nAnother one, another favorite that we've found a couple of times recently, which is buying dinners or paying for hotel rooms on the company card. So like, you know, especially at a bigger startup, this stuff can kind of blend in, like it's harder to catch. It's harder to know exactly who, what was warranted. Maybe there was a conference and some one books, pays for an extra hotel room or they just do it out of the blue. Same thing with dinners. This is an area of theft. We've had a couple people at clients over the years go completely rogue and have like no conscience or they're not thinking even remotely correctly and will start buying clothes, jewelry, weird stuff like that. Do not let that happen. That's why check all your statements every month. That's why you checked QuickBooks. That's why you look at the general ledger. \n\nAnd so they've got the company's credit card in their Uber or Lyft account, and come weekend time, they're taking Uber or Lyft to go out with their friends and it accidentally hits the company's credit card. And again, I'm calling this unintentional. Maybe someone malicious could take advantage of this, but this is one where you really wanna coach your employees on switching the default credit card back to their personal credit card. Same thing goes for Amazon. Like a lot of companies, you know, a lot of companies used to buy a lot of office stuff from Costco. And Costco was kind of like a, you know, it was just a different relationship than Amazon. \n\nB\nAnd so we're the ones saying hey, these transactions look weird. And this video was inspired by something that happened last week. I had this call last week with a client who, you know, allegedly, probably $60,000 was stolen from this client. And so if you have someone who has a second set of eyes on it, who's actually checking the stuff and knows what regular transaction volume looks like and what it's supposed to look like, it will really prevent you from experiencing fraud. The other thing is the employees know that someone else is looking at the books. If they just think it's you, and you're strapped for time, and you're running in a bunch of different directions, and maybe you're not an ace accountant, it might embolden them. So having the second set of eyes is really, really powerful. One more way is doing regular budget to actuals. \n\nSo, budget to actuals, you take your financial model, and it should be on a monthly basis, and every month when we send you your financials, you or we, we offer the service, we paste them into the model and can show variances and show what's way over budget and what's way under budget. And so, and it's a service we offer at Kruze, but you can do this on your own, too. You do not have to work with us. It's very easy to do this on your own as well, but that's when you start seeing like big hops in meals and entertainment or office expenses or fraudulent vendors or things like that. That's where it's gonna really show up because you're gonna look at the last couple of months and be like, wow, how did my office expenses go up $10,000 this month? And it turns out someone bought a piece of jewelry with the company credit card, right? So budget to actuals are your friend. Budget to actuals are helpful in like, five different ways. You know what you're spending money on, you can communicate with your venture capitalists. They can get confidence from you, but like budget to actuals is a very baseline fraud prevention activity.",

And today we're talking about why a startup pays more in social security taxes, like payroll taxes early in the year than later in the year. And there's a really good reason for that and it's related to social security taxes. \n\nNow, social security taxes are actually officially known as OASDI taxes, that stands for Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance. So it's definitely a mouthful but the shorthand is social security taxes. And one thing about social security taxes is they actually cap out on the maximum taxable income. So, in 2021, if someone made over $142,800 after that the next dollar after that, there's no social security taxes, basically it's capped at a certain level. Now the limit in 2022 is gonna be $147,000. So, say you make $147,000 and one dollar. \n\nWell, that last dollar is not gonna be taxed for social security taxes. And so what you can imagine is, as a company kinda goes through the year and has a, you know, people are kind of making relatively the same amount of money throughout the year. People who are highly paid you know, engineer, sales people, folks like that who make more than this year, $147,000, they might eclipse that late in the year maybe like November, December, they're past that limit and therefore social security taxes are not gonna be taken out of their paycheck or the company's payroll and the dollar amount goes down. \n\nSo this throws off a lot of our clients sometimes when they're looking at their payroll line items throughout the year and especially what happens is come January, some of those employees are now paying social security taxes, the company's paying social security taxes and all of a sudden the payroll taxes look a lot higher and it weirds them out. \n\nSo I just want everyone to know if you have a lot of people who are high earners, engineer, sales people, folks like that. And at some point in the year, they're gonna pass the cap and not gonna have social security taxes taken out. Now, that's the gist of the answer. There is one other reason why social security taxes can go down and that's, if your startup does an R&D Tax Credit and we do tons of these at Kruze Consulting, you actually get the payroll tax offset assuming you fit the criteria. \n\nAnd so you actually may see times on your profit and loss statement where you're reading across where all of a sudden you weren't paying much in payroll taxes because of the R&D Tax Credit offset. And then all of a sudden you use up that entire R&D Tax Credit, and guess what? You're paying social security taxes again. So that's the other edge case and, you know, most Kruze clients actually do the R&D Tax Credit 'cause we're in the venture financing, super intense technology, research development type of industries. \n\nBut the bigger more prevalent issue is just that the OASDI tax that are known as social security tax has been maxed out for a lot of the employees in the company on those employees. So hope that helps if you have any questions on payroll taxes on R&D Tax Credit or just plain accounting, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com. Thanks so much.",

We typically recommend Bill.com, but they don't do the international. So for international contractors, use PayPal, TransferWise, OFX or Payoneer. We see that TransferWise and PayPal are usually the two most popular. No matter what system you use, you're going to want to do an export so that you can send all the payments that you did that month to your accountant. That way your accountant can match up all the invoices on Bill.com with all those international payments made through another system. So to summarize, I would recommend using TransferWise or PayPal and always do that once a month export to make it easier on your accountant. Thanks so much.",

      "description": "Paying PTO if your startup is shutting down\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm talking about the importance of paying PTO, if your startup is shutting down. \n\nAnd so really I'm talking to the management teams, and the board of directors, of startups that, you know, unfortunately are struggling and aren't going to make it. And this is a way of life in startup world. Like a lot of the, a lot of great companies don't make it, but they go on, the management teams go on and start another company. So it's important to shut down your company correctly, and take care of employees and avoid liability. And so that's why I'm making this video for you. So PTO is paid time off. \n\nIn most states, it is required to, you know, in California, in New York, most states you have to pay PTO no matter what, even when the company is going down. And the important thing for startups to know is that you, as an executive team and the board, are fiduciaries, and you can actually be personally liable for the PTO, if you don't pay it. That means a employee who gets, you know, doesn't get their PTO payment can actually sue you personally, take you to court, win money plus penalties, plus court costs, and actually you have to pay it. So that is why it is so, so important to pay PTO costs. \n\nAnd so oftentimes this is actually the last trigger for a company to shut down. Everyone, you know, the board, and the management team is looking at the cash balance, knows the runway, but that PTO liability is out there, and everyone just kind of calls it a day. So I always kind of say like, if things are not looking good, and you've exhausted all your fundraising potential, and the board or insiders don't want to do a bridge round, then three months start thinking about this stuff. Most people have, you know, at least a month's worth of, or two weeks to a month worth of built up PTO. So it's going to be a decent sized check you have to write the employees. \n\nNow, you know, some folks say, well, hey, my company has unlimited PTO. Is this an issue? And with unlimited PTO, you actually don't have an ongoing liability. You've basically just told everyone they can take as much time off as they want. You don't track it. You don't have this liability. It sounds really good, but there are some downsides with unlimited PTO. I've done that in another video, you can check out, but the real thing I just want to drive home here is, budget for your PTO to be paid out, pay it out aggressively. \n\nDo not leave the employees hanging. It's a huge amount of liability for the management, and the board. It's also going to leave like a really negative feeling with the employees. And if you're going to start another company, you probably will work with some of the people that you're working with on this startup. Always think long-term always thinking of the future. Take care of the people. Pay the PTO, avoid liability. You'll be much happier. And if you have any questions on this, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com. Happy to answer your questions. Thanks.",

Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn Kruze Consulting. And today, we're talking about what it's like to be a San Francisco startup bookkeeper. Now it's a super challenging job, but also really fun. Now we get to work with some of the best founders in the entire startup ecosystem. Across the world, across the country. Some of the best people are in San Francisco, but that also comes with some pressure. Because venture capitalists really want the financials to be accurate. They want the companies to be in tax compliance. So there's a lot of pressure being a San Francisco startup bookkeeper. So some of the things we do are make sure those financials are perfect. Tiptop shape. And we can do that; especially when we have a little bit of feedback and time with the CEOs. It makes our job a heck of a lot easier. The other thing we do that's really fun is we get the startups on all the best financial systems. So maybe it's Gusto, Rippling for payroll and Bill.com. And Expensify and QuickBooks for other solutions. But getting them all set up is actually really fun. If you're someone like us that likes fixing things and setting things up, being a startup bookkeeper's actually really great. And then the final thing we're really good at is helping the companies get compliance on taxes. Now, San Francisco's almost like another state. In most startups, they just have to deal with the federal government and the state government. But in San Francisco, there's a payroll tax. There's a gross receipts tax. There's an asset test. There's a business registration has to be done once a year. There are tons of other tax liabilities you have to deal with in San Francisco. If you're based there. And so we're really good at it. And there's nothing better than talking to the founders after we've taken care of all that stuff. And they're like, oh, my God, you saved me so much time. You really distressed me. So those are the best parts of our job of being a bookkeeper in San Francisco. Now, some of the challenges. It's really hard to get time on the CEOs calendar sometimes. That's true for anyone who's helping startup. CEOs are pulled in many, many different ways. But we have some really good systems. We always insist on a monthly call with our founders, CEOs. So that helps. But it's definitely hard. And sometimes we got to do the old pick up the phone and say, Hey, we haven't talked in two months. We really gotta talk now. But overall, it's a super rewarding job. We love it.\nWe help like over 200 companies. That's really amazing. So that's what it's like a day in the life of a San Francisco startup bookkeeper.",

      "description": "What’s behind the huge increase in VC requests for financials\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $10 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today, we're covering what's behind the huge increase in financials requests from venture capitalists. \n\nThis is something that we're seeing. It's pretty crazy right now like we're getting flooded. And what we're getting is VCs asking for both historicals, and a lot of scrutiny on the financial model of a company like the go forward projections. And this has always been a part of the due diligence for VCs. But, you know, I think what we see happening right now is the deal velocity in 2020 and 2021 was so high, as in so fast, that venture capitalists were doing cursory checks on the financials, but really kind of buying in to the company's story, and the vision a lot more. And now, with the NASDAQ declining and the VC funding market getting a little tougher we see venture capitalists really just digging in, and scrutinizing both how money was spent previously, and also what the future looks like. \n\nOverall, I think this is really healthy. It forces tougher conversations earlier in the relationship between founders and VCs. There was just a lot of like shotgun marriages happening because founders were picking VCs based on term sheets, and venture capitalists were using price as a weapon, or a negotiating tactic instead of getting to know the founders as well. And so, I think this is really going to help folks in the future, but it does mean that if you're a startup your financials need to be in good shape, your projections need to be in good shape, and you need to be able to talk through them. And a venture capitalist is going to ask you some questions. \n\nNow, again, remember especially when it comes to financial projections, VCs, they're not wanting you to be like a Goldman Sachs M&A analyst or something like that, who can model anything in Excel. They're looking for a way to talk through your story, and how you're going to spend money, and what the milestones are for your company. So it's more of a map than like a precise something that, you know, needs to be exactly right. Like it's got to be directionally correct. You need to be able to defend it. And you also need to be able to use it to give a venture capitalist a sense of where the company's going. \n\nSo also, by the way, one of the other factors driving this is that in tough times, VC funds only have so many dollars to support existing companies. And so what we're seeing also is venture capital partners they feel like they owe it to their other partners to really dig in and do that diligence because whenever a venture capital firm, you know, a top tier firm makes a commitment, there's this implicit promise of support, AKA another check down the road. \n\nAnd so all the partners in a fund know that if they're doing new investments, they need to be allocating some extra money reserves down the line. We have another video on VC reserves but basically they need to make sure that the company they're investing in is not going to like blow through the cash and come back to the partnership in nine months, or 12 months, or something crazy short, and need more money. And so they owe it to each other. Not only do they owe it to the entrepreneur to make sure that's scrutinized and make sure the best decisions are made, but they owe it to the other partners inside the funds. \n\nSo, again, I think this is a really positive trend, and it's really going to help companies long-term and help the VC funds long-term. But it is a shift, we're seeing it, and just be prepared, know that you're going to have a lot more scrutiny on your financials, and your projections going forward.

      "description": "What is Revenue-Based Financing?\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today we're talking about revenue-based loans. \n\nAnd so these are loans that the lender is underwriting your revenue flow, and also taking payments in return. They're returning their principal back out of your revenue. So there's a bunch of companies that do this. It's been actually like a pretty new space. Lighter Capital is one of the big firms in the venture capital-backed startup space that does this but it's been around for a long time. Typically, the lenders will take something like 3 to 6% of your monthly revenue back, and these loans usually get paid back over like three years. The expected IRR is anywhere from like 10% annually to 20% annually. So that's your cost of capital. \n\nWhen I say IRR, I'm talking about the lender's return. But really if you're a startup borrower, you're paying something like 10 to 20% interest on the loans. And again, these lenders are really underwriting the health of your business, and your burn rates, and things like that. But they're also very focused on revenue, specifically reoccurring revenue. They love SaaS businesses, they love businesses that have this reoccurring revenue flow so that they know over time, with a minimized churn, they can get paid back and make good money. \n\nAnd so that's the kind of startup they're looking to lend to. When I bring up churn, it reminds me, they often will have some covenants in there, and they'll actually underwrite based on your churn. So if you're growing and have a great reoccurring revenue stream, fantastic, you have access to capital through these revenue-based loans but if you have a high churn, they're actually going to bring the amount of money, like the advanced amount or advanced rate amount way, way down. \n\nSo just know that. Churn's actually going to be a major metric for them that they're going to focus on. And these have been popular. I kind of find that they're less popular with VC-backed companies, merely because VC-backed companies usually raise a lot of money in equity, A, don't always need debt, but when they do need debt, they'll typically go more towards a bank, like Silicon Valley Bank or Bridge Bank, Comerica, or they'll go to a fund lender like WCI, TriplePoint, Hercules, some of those folks because when they have the VC backing, those lenders will underwrite not just the enterprise value of the company, but also how willing the VCs are to stick with the business, to write another check if things get tough, and so typically, their access to debt capital is actually a lot better than a company that's like maybe a bootstrap startup that hasn't raise venture capital yet. \n\nSo in my world, I'm seeing a lot of the revenue loans going to companies that are pre-VC funding but have a little bit of traction or bootstrap companies that made the conscious decision not to raise any equity, or bootstrap/angel-funded companies that maybe raised a million or $2 million of angel funding, don't have a big institutional VC behind them though and are building to a milestone that will allow them to raise that big VC check. So again, once you have the VC money, there's a whole group of venture lenders that are available to you that often kind of make the revenue-based loans less attractive, especially at the IRR part of that. \n\nBut they are a really good option for companies that are bootstrapping or raised a little bit of equity but not a ton, and can see a milestone right there in front of them, and once they hit that milestone, they'll be able to raise a bunch of money from VCs. So that's where we're seeing it, and it's a good asset category for your lender. \n\nAnd if you're a startup, it can really help fill a void when you're in that like, I call it the teenager phase, when you're a tweener, you're not quite ready to be VC-backed but you've got something much more than just an idea, a piece of paper. You've actually customers that are paying you. So check out revenue-based loans. Lighter Capital, there's some other folks out there that are doing this. \n\nAnd the space has really actually exploded, so there's a lot of options in this category. Hope that helps.

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\n- The first thing that makes it hard is revenue accounting. Now revenue, most people think, oh, cash in cash out. No big deal. But actually you should be working off in an accrual method, but even if you're not doing a cash method, you need to look at your gross revenue, which is like all your sales, total sales. \n\n- The next aspect we're going to talk about is inventory accounting. Inventory accounting can be pretty, relatively easy or pretty hairy. So the first thing you need to think about with inventory is whether you're buying products already manufactured, already kind of ready to go, or if you're making or manufacturing them yourself. So let's go after the ones where you're buying from the manufacturer. That's relatively easy. You're getting the invoice for all the products you purchase, and you're going to need to track that somewhere. You're going to track it either in you know, not ideal, but you can use a Google sheet or there's some tools that plug into QuickBooks online that are pretty good that you can use, but you're going to track that entire list of products and how much it costs for each one of them. So that's how you do the basics of buying from a third party manufacturer. \n\n- Now let's talk about cost of goods sold. As we said, your inventory like the actual units you sold are one of the largest components into your cost of goods sold. \n\n- Third-party logistics providers will often charge you a storage fee and a shipping fee. Both those need to go into cost of goods sold. So again, you've got the inventory cost and the inventory cost can be calculated either based on the average cost of your inventory, or what's called last in first out, meaning LIFO, which means the oldest inventory gets sold next. And so you look at your sheet or look at your system and all the oldest inventory is what, the cost of those products actually get pushed to cost of goods sold. Those are the two kind of main ways. Then you're going to have the storage and distribution fees. Then you're going to have transaction processing costs like Stripe or Shopify fees. Those are, you know, Shopify is like the dominant eCommerce software platform right now. So you're going to see all those fees loaded in the cost of goods sold as well. Now we talked about 3PLs or third party logistics providers. \n\n- The last thing that makes eCommerce accounting difficult is just the high transaction volume. There is a lot going on, a lot of widgets going out the door, t-shirts, candles, whatever you're thinking, people are selling. And because the transaction velocity is a lot higher, there's a lot more that can go wrong. And so you wouldn't think about it 'cause it is a fairly straightforward transaction, but there's a lot of refunds and discounts that also need to be applied. So eCommerce companies in general, have a little bit more of a complicated accounting system than just your average startup. And you know, one final bonus thing to think about, this isn't in our top five list, but it probably should be, is you really want to be able to calculate your marketing expenditure, advertising expenditure on platforms like Google and Facebook and any other thing you're using for customer acquisition and be able to calculate an ROI on that. \n\nA lot of times people think of it in terms of customer acquisition cost and return on customer acquisition cost. So, typically VCs like to invest in companies that have something like a 3 to 5X multiple on customer acquisition costs. So you spend 50 bucks to get a customer. Ideally you're getting $250 of basically gross profit, not even just revenue, but gross profit. That is a huge winning combination if you're an investor and if you're running eCommerce platform, that's a great deal and something that someone's going to want to invest in. If your ratio is a lot lower, it might be hard to attract investment, you might have to move a little bit slower, bootstrap, maybe take on a little bit of debt, but that's something you really want to watch out for, and it really helps if you have a financial model to track that. \n\nAt Kruze, we have a bunch of financial models for free on our website. You can just Google Kruze financial models, and those will help you figure out your customer acquisition costs and your multiple of return on customer acquisition. So I hope that helps, a lot going on in eCommerce. It's not an easy place to do accounting, but there's just a ton of growth there. \n\nCongratulations to all you entrepreneurs out there who are building great eCommerce companies. And please look us up at Kruze. We'd love to help you out. Thanks.",

      "description": "Shopify Lets you Offer different payment methods\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about the payment methods accepted by Shopify. And for everyone who doesn't know, Shopify is kinda the go-to de facto e-commerce store software. \n\nSo I think hundreds of thousands, if not millions of e-commerce providers actually use Shopify to host their store and sell anything they want to sell. And so it's really important, at Kruze, we have a pretty big focus on Shopify and the Shopify ecosystem for e-commerce clients. And so it's worth going through just the payment methods that work inside of Shopify. And the cool thing about Shopify is it's really just this big software platform. So there's even more payment methods than I'm covering right here. \n\nBut I'm just going to go over the big ones just to help educate you and let you know what your options are. So the first one is just the Shopify payment or sometimes people call it ShopPay. But actually that is processed through Stripe. It's kind of a quiet secret but Stripe actually, which is a big payment processor, it's a startup, late-stage startup, actually does Shopify Pay or Shopify merchant channel. So that's nice. You have both the inherent credibility of Shopify and you know Stripe does tons of volume. It really knows what they're doing so your payments are gonna get processed in an accurate way. So that's kinda the first option. \n\nThe second option is good old PayPal, which it feels like everyone has a PayPal account these days. It's been around for 25 years. It's been to go-to for sending your friends money, sending business people money. And so Shopify enables PayPal also, which is really nice. The third one to cover is Amazon. Amazon, Shopify in a way competes with Amazon but it feels like everyone has an Amazon account and so Shopify very smartly actually lets Amazon Payments sit on their platform, 'cause it just makes it easier for the end customer, the buyer to convert. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, all these payment options are there just to make sure that if someone's gonna buy something from your store, they're not locked into one payment option. They can use whatever is convenient for them. So Amazon's a really good option. Stripe, we talked about a little bit as powering the Shopify gateway but in geographies that Shopify does not have emerging gateway, you'll usually find Stripe. Stripe has more global coverage than Shopify. And so sometimes, you'll see that little Stripe button popping up as well if you're in a different geography. \n\nAnd then the final one to cover is a relatively new one called Affirm. Affirm is kinda like being able to make payments on a purchase instead of just buying it all upfront. So for example, maybe you buy a $1,000 piece of equipment from an e-commerce provider. And you don't quite have $1,000 or you wanna delay the payments a little bit, Affirm will let you do something like four payments of $250 or slightly more, like a little bit of extra in there just to make it worth it for Affirm and for Shopify and for the whole network. But basically, Affirm is pretty nice because it's one of the first options that lets you delay paying everything upfront. \n\nAnd I recently saw Affirm is gonna file for an IPO and do a big public offering. So they're legit. They've raised a ton of money and they have a lot of volume going over their network, too. \n\nSo I hope that helps. The big ones again, Shopify, or ShopPay, which is powered by Stripe. PayPal, Amazon, and Stripe itself and then you've got Affirm. Those are big payment options for Shopify merchants. Hope that helps.",

Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about Shopify sales channel reporting. \n\nAnd basically, the cool thing about Shopify, which for those who don't know, it's kind of the go-to e-commerce store provider for hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people who are selling e-commerce stuff over the internet. Shopify actually has a really cool reporting system that can let you see how much you've sold by channel. \n\nAnd this is important because there's some channels that are inherently organic, like Google. And there's some that are inherently paid like Instagram, Facebook, things like that. And so knowing where your customers are coming from and what they're actually buying and how much they're buying is really important, because that cycles back into what you wanna pay on a customer acquisition cost, what you're gonna pay for advertising to get those customers to your site. \n\nAnd so this is just a partial list, but you've got the Google report, you've got Instagram, you've got Facebook, you have Facebook stores, you have Amazon, Pinterest and you even have the Walmart marketplace. So those are, if you kind of think about those are like the big traffic centers for online shopping. \n\nAnd so Shopify, by virtue of having this report can really help its e-commerce store providers really be smart about where they're gonna spend money, what kind of customers are coming to them and really just optimize their store for conversion. And so we do a ton of stuff at Kruze with e-commerce companies and pretty much all of them use Shopify. And so this is just one of our favorite parts. \n\nAnd so I wanted everyone to know about it because again, the smarter you are about your spend and the better you are about conversion, the more you can spend and you get that really nice flywheel going and you can build a really big e-commerce business. So I hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "How to Breakout Shopify Fees for Accurate Financials\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm gonna explain how to break out your Shopify fees for accurate financials. \n\nSo, Shopify is the e-commerce software platform of choice. Everyone's flocking to Shopify to host their store and make all their transactions really easy. In the old days, you'd hack together a website to try to sell something or have to pay a million dollars for a piece of software to do e-commerce but nowadays, Shopify have a really accessible price point. It's really easy to use and there's, I think hundreds of thousands of stores on Shopify. So it really makes a difference to know how to actually treat the information you're getting from Shopify in your accounting system. \n\nAnd so let's walk through this here. So first, the people who are buying, the end customer, they don't really see the fees. It's transparent to them. They just are happy to go to a website, find a pair of shoes or a necklace or whatever it is they like, purchase it and use one of the very easy payment options and boom, they're done. And they know that it's gonna get shipped to them and they can track that. So for the end customer, Shopify is really amazing. \n\nNow, for the vendor, for the person that owns the e-commerce site, it's actually really amazing too, but there are a couple fees you have to pay when you use Shopify. So the first one is called basically like a platform fee. It's just like the cost of using Shopify. But then when you're doing e-commerce and you're actually shipping things, there's a second fee. It's called a shipping fee. And so both of these actually technically should be in cost of goods sold, but the way it automatically comes into QuickBooks it's just like one big bundle of fees. You can't actually split them out natively or easily in QuickBooks. You actually need some more information. \n\nNow, luckily, Shopify provides an invoice, so you can actually see the itemized platform fees and shipping fees in your account for every month. And so what a good accountant would do, like us at Kruze, is we go into that invoice and we actually break out the platform fees. That's one line item in cost of goods sold. That's like the software cost to host your store. And then we break out the second line item, which is shipping fees. \n\nNow, those two different sets of fees are gonna go totally different ways. They're gonna be different and so that's why you want to break them out. You wanna know this because you'll actually have a better view on your gross margin. You'll know if you should be some day, somewhere start using a new shopping platform because it's cheaper or easier or if the shipping fees are just eating into your profits so badly that you're gonna have to find another shipping option. \n\nSo having that visibility on gross margin is really important. And we're very thankful that Shopify does provide that invoice because it allows the Kruze Consulting accountants to deliver really nice accurate financials for the e-commerce customers. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "How to read an Income Statement\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nYou wanna manage your company in a really smart way. This is like the barometer of your company, it's maybe one of the most important things besides just the number, which is the cash in the bank. Like that's probably number one, how to read Income Statement, number two. So you're gonna start off with revenue. \n\nAnd maybe the simplest way to say this is just, revenue is widgets times the price of the widget. So if you're selling a software license, you sell one license, you charge 100 bucks, that means you generate $100 worth of revenue. That is the top line, as a lot of people refer to it. \n\nThe next line item in an income statement is your cost of goods sold. Now, this is all the costs associated with delivering your service or selling your widget. So for online businesses, like SaaS companies, it typically has things like your hosting costs, and your customer support costs and all the little things that go into actually developing and delivering your product. \n\nFor E-commerce providers, typically, it's whatever you're buying your inventory for, and sometimes like shipping charges and things like that, or 3PL charges. But basically the cost of delivering your widget or your service. \n\nNow you're gonna subtract that from revenue. And this gives you gross margin. So you often hear venture capitalists and founders talking about how it's better to run or invest in a high gross margin business. Because that means you have a lot more cash, a lot more margin to work with from your income statement. It allows you to invest more money in the next group of expense categories, which are called your operating expenses. \n\nThe next category is General Administrative Expenses, G&A. Now this is like the overhead, this is where your accountant goes and maybe your lawyer goes. Anything that's kind of like just typical business overhead will go in General and Administrative Expenses. So you take all three of those R&D, sales and marketing, G&A. Those are your operating expenses. You're gonna add them all together, and you're gonna subtract your operating expenses from your gross margin, or gross profit, some people call it. This will give you your operating profit. \n\nNow, this is all, it's almost like your net profit. This is almost what your take home is. This is a really good barometer for the company. Sometimes you'll hear the term EBITDA thrown around, which is basically just your operating profit. And you're gonna add back depreciation amortization. But this is the benchmark for most companies, especially more mature companies. Banks will look at this to make sure there's enough operating profit in the company before they wanna make a loan. \n\nThe next line items are interest expenses or interest income. So if you have a lot of money in the bank and you're getting a good interest rate, you can generate interest income. A lot of companies that have debt, they're actually paying interest expenses here. And then other income, maybe other kind of weird things that pop in, will be here. And you're gonna subtract them or add them if it's a interest gained into the operating income. And you're gonna get to net income. This is your net profit. This is pretty much what you get to take home. We'll talk about the cash flow statement and adjustments to net income a little bit later. But this is the core barometer of your company. This is what bankers really like to look at. 'Cause you might be producing a really good operating income but have huge interest expenses, which eat up your whole operating income. \n\nSo net profit, just think about it as like your take home, what the company is actually producing for all the work. And that's at the bottom of the income statement. So again, from all the way from the top to the bottom, you've got revenue, you subtract from revenue, your cost of goods sold. That gets you the gross margin or gross profit, Then you're gonna subtract research and development, sales and marketing, General Administrative, those are your operating expenses. You get down to operating income, and then you're to subtract interest expenses or other expenses. And you'll get to net profit. \n\nAnd your net profit is gonna feed in to both your balance sheet and your cash flow statement. We'll talk about that in other videos. But really, it's kind of the bottom line. It's what the company is really producing. \n\nNow, I hope this little exploration of how to read income statements has been helpful. And again, founders, entrepreneurs, it is so important that you learn how to do this. So we will produce more content and help you learn how to read these in even more depth. I hope that helps, thanks.",

      "description": "How to Finance Your Ecommerce Company\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\neCommerce companies are pretty interesting because there's actually a wide range of options. If you're building like a software company or a hardware company, you're gonna kind of default to venture capital investment because it's so capital intensive. But for eCommerce companies, you can actually get up and running pretty quickly and actually produce a positive, gross margin, positive net margin. So, the first option for how to finance your eCommerce company is bootstrapping. Like, do it yourself and have your customers finance you. \n\nBut I think bootstrapping, especially if you're just kinda coming out of the box with a new concept. I think that's a really good way of financing your eCommerce company at first. So that's number one. Number two, would be actual venture capital investment. And, you know, eCommerce was a venture capital darling for a long time. And then it went through kind of a little bit of a trough where it was actually hard to get eCommerce companies financed. And then COVID hit and everything changed. And everyone wanted to buy things through the internet, drop shipping was made available in a much easier way. And all of a sudden now eCommerce companies and brand companies that just go direct, are exploding. And venture capitalists are writing huge checks to those companies because their metrics look great. They've kind of realized that maybe eCommerce adoption was dramatically accelerated by COVID. \n\nSo VCs will write you those checks and I think venture capitalists like eCommerce but they especially like it when it's around branded products. Like where the company isn't just the distribution channel like Amazon, eBay, you know, those kinda things. That's old, kind of old school, but has a brand that the market recognizes people, admire, want to own their products. And can use things like Shopify or big commerce to actually power the website and power the eCommerce operations. \n\nThe third option is banks. Banks will actually lend you money. And, there's two kinds of banks. There's banks for if you're bootstrapped. And those, you know, those are more of a personal loan like the bank will loan money to your startup but they'll typically ask you to do a personal guarantee. Which means you're on the hook if the company doesn't succeed, you have to pay that loan back no matter what. The second kind of loan is, what's called venture debt for, for companies that have raised venture capital and they are making a bet on the company, a bet on the VCs. \n\nIf you raise VC money, you're not going to need to do a personal guarantee. But you know, banks that are requiring personal guarantees they will actually fund quite a bit. Like they'll look at your assets and look at your track record and your credit scores and things like that. But they're also really going to take into account the fundamentals of the business. And so that's a great option, especially if you're bootstrapping through a big growth spurt. \n\nAnd now they're, you know, we have clients that are 5 to 10 times bigger than they were before COVID. And all of that inventory has been sold and the margin's been captured and now they've been paying back their lenders and some of them don't even have debt anymore. So, it was kind of a one-time thing. But bank debt is a good option for you. The fourth option is what I'll call kind of more aggressive debt. So that's the kind of debt that like Shopify Capital or Stripe Capital or Fundbox. Or there's, you know, 10 types of, 10 lenders like this that are doing kind of online - Kabbage is another one, online lending. They will do advances, but they are looking... If you're a small business that hasn't raised VC money, they are looking for personal guarantees. These platforms have the advantage of being able to see your exact sales. \n\nSo just know that's more expensive debt. So that's one reason people like banks, banks tend to be cheap. They leverage that personal guarantee to give you money at 4, 5, 6%, versus that 15% from non-bank lenders. It's all about their cost of capital and these have a very, very cheap cost of capital because they rely on deposits for the cost of capital. So I hope that helps. You've got five choices. All of them are good. They're all gonna be, you know, for different scenarios or different situations your eCommerce is in, the company's in. And you know what? You may actually, you may start off bootstrapping. And then you may raise some venture capital and then you may raise some bank debt.",

      "description": "How do eCommerce companies manage their inventory?\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question, how do eCommerce companies manage their inventory? \n\nAnd really there's kinda two key ways. The first is like the old school, been done for hundreds and hundreds of years which is, own or rent your own warehouses, handle, have all the product, all the inventory delivered there and have your own warehouse team actually managing it, tracking it, signing it out, signing it in, or these days scanning it in, scanning out when it gets shipped. That is the age-old way. And for companies that are getting pretty big that's actually a good way of doing it. 'Cause you can kind of capture economies of scale, you know what's going on. But if you think about it there's a lot of hassles inherent in that. Like you've got to actually rent or buy warehouse space which probably is not like one of the things you're the best at as a company, if you're an eCommerce company. And then you've got to hire all the staff and spend a lot of money. And you gotta buy a lot of software to manage all the inventory. \n\nSo there's a lot of costs associated with managing your warehouse. And so third-party logistics providers, 3PLs for short, have emerged. And probably the most famous is really Amazon. Amazon has a huge amount of warehouses across the country. And a lot of eCommerce companies that sell on Amazon actually have their inventory sitting in Amazon's warehouses that also helps with Prime and One-Day Delivery and things like that. And Shopify is working on something similar. So those are... Amazon, it's probably the one that comes to mind but there are a huge amount of 3PLs out there that have emerged because eCommerce has become just a gigantic category, and Amazon charges a lot. And a lot of people who sell online don't wanna sell through Amazon or don't want Amazon to have the full picture of what's going on for fear of competitive problems or replicating the goods. \n\nAnd so there's a lot of independent third-party logistics providers out there who will charge you essentially like a markup or a fee per unit that you're actually storing with them and that they sell, they handle and they help get it into the shipping and get it out to the customer. So I'm actually a pretty big fan of third-party logistics providers because they let you as an owner or founder of an eCommerce company, focus on what you're really good at. There's very few eCommerce founders who are amazing at logistics. They'd be just in a different business. \n\nAnd again, there are a lot of capital expenditures like a lot of money up front to actually have a working warehouse on your own. So that's why this has become super valuable. And one other benefit of 3PLs is you can actually get pretty good data feeds as an accountant for what's actually going out the door and what's getting sold. And that makes the accounting so much easier for us, Kruze Consulting. We do a ton of eCommerce companies and we love those data feeds. We love easy reporting. It makes accounting for the inventory so much easier. And you know, while I'm on this topic, let's talk really quickly about like the difference between if you're assembling inventory or a bill of materials in your warehouse versus buying it directly and having a third-party logistics provider handle it. Like that's been one of the really exciting things that's happened in the last five years or so maybe 10 years is a lot of startups, eCommerce companies have been buying directly from contract manufacturers. And so in the accounting world that's like one line item per good. And it's really easy to account for on cost of goods sold. It becomes a real pain when you are buying raw materials, assembling that raw materials into a finished good. \n\nAnd you have to track all of that on a monthly basis on inventory worksheets and actually get to a cost of goods sold per unit. So again, it's the same trend as third-party logistics providers. It's so nice to work with a contract manufacturer who could prepare your stuff, have it, sent to you complete that makes the accounting way, way easier. So probably the common theme you're seeing or hearing from what I'm talking about here is focus on what you're good at, which is typically brand, typically customer acquisition, typically product. And you can outsource a lot of the inventory management and also inventory production if you're an eCommerce company. So if you have any questions on this, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com and we will answer your questions. Thanks.",

      "description": "How to allocate Pro-Rata correctly on Convertible Notes done in between Priced Rounds?\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $5.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nPriced rounds are your traditional series A, series B. There's a price per share, it's a preferred price. Liquidation preferences, et cetera. Convertible notes are typically used as an interim financing tool that don't set a valuation, but typically have a cap, which is kind of a valuation that everyone agrees things will convert at if things are going well. And, so, you see convertible notes being used in between rounds as a bridge round, or a bridge note, or something just kind of quick and dirty, because an investor might come into a company and really wanna do that investment. And, the investors say like, \"Hey, we're not doing a full fledged fundraising round right now, but we'll take a few million dollars 'cause that'll be helpful to us too.\" \n\nAnd, so, you really need to think about if you're taking this money in a convertible note, or SAFE note, this applies for SAFE notes too, you really need to think about the pro-rata allocations. And, so, pro-rata is an investor right, where investors get to always protect their investment percentage, or ownership percentage, going forward. So, if an investor owns 20% and new money's coming into the company, depending on the valuation, they actually get to put a little bit more money into the company if they have pro-rata rights, to maintain that 20% ownership going forward. And, so, founders are the ones who always experience the dilution, the venture capitalists can always put more money in to protect their ownership percentage. And, you've seen many of them doing that, especially in really great companies, like the VC's wanna protect their pro-rata ownership like crazy 'cause this is a winner, this is gonna make them a ton of money, and it's probably gonna still be a great investment for them. \n\nThere're two things happening. The first is how much of the new convertible notes should each investor do, or get to do? And, so, this is actually a pretty simple one in that you're gonna look at the cap table, and everyone has their ownership allocations already, and, so, it's very easy to see. Like in Carta, or your lawyer spreadsheet, whatever you're using for cap table software. And, so, the company will actually split the convertible note, or safe note, up according to the percentage ownership that all the investors already hold. And, so, you can imagine if it's a $5 million convertible note, or safe note, then whoever owns 20% of the company is gonna get to put it in $1 million. \n\nNow, this can be a little bit complicated because often times the founders won't be able to protect their own ownership through a convertible note. So, it's typically going to default to the preferred ownership levels. But, again, this is one that's not so hard. You can actually just look at the cap table and make the allocations accordingly. \n\nNow, the second part of this question is what does the pro-rata on the next round look like after you factor in the participation in the convert? And, so, what's happening here is a lot of investors are happy to do that bridge round, or in between financing, or they're getting greedy and want to preemptively put money in. They're happy to do it, but a lot of them, especially in the situations that aren't like the greatest, like the company is doing okay, but not on fire, kicking butt. They will want this investment in the convert to be credited against the amount of pro-rata they would have been doing when the full round comes in. \n\nNow, of course, venture capitalists are very good at sensing a company doing well, and very good at talking their way into putting more money into this company and getting more ownership. So, that's a happy situation, when your VC's are demanding / asking very politely to put more money into the company. That means things are going well and they sense an opportunity. But, it's also important to plan for when things aren't going great. And, that's where this million dollars now going to convertible note, million dollars going in later when the full round closes. So, just know your venture capitalists don't, you know, they do reserve. They don't have an inexhaustible amount of money to continue to support the company. If the company's a rocket ship and gonna do an IPO, they'll find a way. If the company is doing well, but not a superstar, they're only gonna be able to allocate a certain amount of capital going forward. So, if you do have that early ask on a convertible note, or a SAFE note, asking them to do a bridge, or in between financing, just know that you're starting to deplete their reserve for your company.",

The convertible note is basically a debt instrument where it's usually good for 18 to 24 months, then it needs to be paid back. And usually, there's a valuation cap, which kind of functions as like the conversion number, so when people put money in, that's usually their effective valuation, assuming the company raised more money later at a higher valuation. So that's convertible notes. And they are debt, and so it's interesting because this question is exactly why SAFE notes were created by Y Combinator and some of the leading Silicon Valley law firms. Basically, once in a while Y Combinator saw convertible notes being abused by angel investors and demanding their money back. \n\nNow, what's interesting is you can be an angel investor, you invest in a startup, in a convertible note, the company's going to spend the money. They're going to build their software, or their solution, or help the drug development, whatever they're doing, and actually spend that money. And so, say the company hasn't raised more money, so the debt doesn't automatically convert, and you, Mr. and Mrs. Angel Investor ask for your money back. Well, there's no money to pay you. The money's been spent. \n\nSo there's kind of like the practical aspect of this, which is the company's out of money anyways, and there's not much that can happen, but there is, sometimes there's value in the company. Either it's going to get bought or sold, or it's on the verge of raising more money, but the angel investors are using the note terms to pressure and try to get more money back. And so they can do that. If you are a creditor and you can find, I think it's two or three other creditors that have not been paid back in a respectful amount of time, you can petition to try to put a company into bankruptcy, but there's a whole process with that. \n\nSo that's like the super extreme version of what could happen if there's a bunch of notes, and maybe the lawyer's not paid, and the water person's not paid, and the gardener, and maybe some of the software developers aren't paid, then all those creditors together can petition to put a company in bankruptcy. But more practically speaking, what happens is the angel investors will kind of try to get their money back, threaten a lot, but whenever this usually happens, usually the company's kind of run out of money already and so there's nothing to give back. \n\nI should say that 99% of angel investors and seed funds will just extend the notes. So you get your kind of 18 to 24 month typical note time period, and if the company's making progress and it's not going to get liquidated, isn't going to go bankrupt, and good things are happening, the founders usually just go back to the investors and say, \"Hey, can you extend this another year or another six months? I need a little bit more time to close a fundraising and then your notes will auto-convert.\" So it is a very tiny problem abused. This leverage created by notes abused by like, not even 1% probably, but it does happen, and so that was one of the main things that YC and some of the law firms were trying to address with SAFE notes. SAFE notes are not debt, they are equity. \n\nThere are some clauses in them now where they say like, you got to pay the investors back first, but there's no kind of trigger. There's no term that says this has to be paid back on a certain date like there is in a convertible note.",

      "title": "What is the Value of Pre-seed Venture Capital Funds?",
      "description": "The first thing that pre-seed funds do is they set the terms and actually price a deal at the really early stage. This is incredibly valuable, because angel investors at that stage, feel so much more comfortable coming into the deal and following a named institutional VC fund.  And so, one of the core services a pre-seed fund is doing is just giving you a term sheet with their name on it, and they're signing their name. And so, you could take that term sheet and fill out the rest of the round. The next thing they do, is they get you thinking like a VC-backed company. It's a huge shift from being bootstrapped or just a super scrappy, three ladies in a garage type of startup. When you take professional money, you have to start doing certain things. You need to have real board meetings. You need to be metrics-driven, instead of just going with your gut so much. The pre-seed fund really helps you make that shift. And they do it kind of in a lower stakes environment than trying to do that after you've taken a 20 million dollar round and learning on the fly. So, it's a great training ground for thinking like a VC-backed company. They make recruiting so much easier for you, because you have some incredible logos. Then you can put on your website that people recognize. And when employees are taking a job at your company, they're really betting their capital, like their time. They're gonna be working for you and spending a lot of time on your company. And so, knowing that some bigger players, some institutional players are behind you really makes recruiting a lot easier. It's the same thing with customers. Now, for small deals customers don't really care who the backers are. But, when they're signing a multi hundred thousand dollar or a multimillion dollar deal with your startup, it really helps to have some institutional VCs that they can reference, that are on your website, and that they have confidence that will help get the company funded. If they're signing up to use your service, they don't want it to go away in six months 'cause you ran out of money. So, that's gonna be very important to them.  Now, another huge benefit of pre-seed funds is that, Seed and Series A funds, follow them like crazy. There's the old speed dial. And those funds all wanna see the best deals coming out of the pre-seed fund. That's kind of like their  minor leagues relative to the major leagues. They're looking for the hot prospect who's really up and coming. And that's where they find them. So, they're really gonna trust the general partners of the pre-seed fund. And when the general partners send them an email, and say, hey, you should look at this company, it's doing really well. They're gonna jump on it. You'll have a meeting within a week. That's how it works. That reputation really matters. Another thing, that pre-seed funds help with, is LPs. Now, you might think, as a startup founder, I don't really care about the LPs. But you should, because if you can get featured in the LP updates from the pre-seed fund, or even better, at the Investor Annual Meeting Day. You get an audience with all the big institutional venture seed funds. You get an audience with all the institutional these LPs that has invested in the pre-seed fund. Guess what they'll stay invest in? Other VC funds. So, it's very common for an LP to tell a Series A fund that hey, I will just act the pre-seed funds Annual Investment Day. There's three hot companies you just take a look at. That happens a lot. It also helps when they have a lot of good updates they get... Let me start with LP ones all over again.  And the final big value ad from pre-seed funds is their LP-based. Now, LPs are investors in the funds. And so, the investors in the pre-seed fund, guess what? They invest in a lot of other kinds of funds including seed and Series A funds. So, it's very common for positive word of mouth to start circulating on a company that they have seen in great updates to the LPs or even better at the Annual Investor Update Meeting. If you've get to presents to the LPs that's really really valuable. You'll have positive buzz. The LPs will probably mention your company to the Series A funds that they invest in.  And guess who else invests in pre-seed funds? Operators or people at really big companies who could potentially buy you someday. So, or sign a really big deal with you. So, there's a ton of good things that happen because of the pre-seed fund LP base. that can actually really propel your company. And it doesn't happen kind of out in the open it's a lot of like... Positive rumors or people getting a good vibe for your company. So, that LP base can be really valuable. So, just to recap. Pre-seed funds help write the first check.",

Please, please don't do that. \n\nAnd, or Rippling basic and say like, \"Hey, why is that so much cheaper than the PEO offerings of Justworks or TriNet, or Rippling has a PEO, Sequoia. And there's actually a really good reason for that because a PEO, Professional Employer Organization, doesn't just handle payroll. They handle payroll just like a normal payroll service would, but they also supply you with medical benefits, and other kinds of benefits, plus HR Services. \n\nPlus they do some state and local tax help. And so, when you're comparing that to just regular payroll, you have to take, you know, you've got two sides of the equation. The regular payroll side of the equation, you have to include the cost of those benefits. Now PEO's, one of their major selling points is like, \"Hey, we'll save you money on benefits because we can pool all these employees across a lot of different companies and negotiate harder.\" Now, the truth is they also charge a much higher fee in general, even though they're offering a bunch of these services. So your instincts are right, when you're looking at Payroll versus PEO, PEO is significantly more expensive. They are offering more services. \n\nIt is like kind of a Premium product. So I'm old enough to say it's a Cadillac, kind of product. Maybe that needs to be like a Tesla nowadays, or something like that. But they do offer a lot more, but just know what you want. There's a lot of startups that are just getting started. They just want to be able to offer payroll because they need to hire people. They're not financially in a place where they can offer benefits yet, or they just want to run normal payroll. That's what we do, we run normal payroll and we work with an Independent Insurance Broker who finds us the best deals across all the States, because we have, we're a totally remote organization at Kruze. We have hired people all across the United States, across the world, really. \n\nAnd so I like the fact that we can work with an insurance broker and pick our own benefits. And we plugged that into Rippling and it's very easy. So we don't pay for like the PEO premium stuff. Also, one question we get a lot around, difference between payroll, and services and then the PEO services like who will do the State Tax Registrations, and that's something that your CPA firm, like Kruze, we will do that for you. So you don't have to hire a CPO if you don't want... a PEO, if you don't want to, your CPA firm can do it. It's actually very cost effective. \n\nSo, you have some very, you have two good choices and it's more of like, do you want to go down the, you know, maybe more cost-effective more control path of payroll and then benefits, and then, you know, doing, working with the CPA firm, who will also do a lot of other stuff for you. Or do you want to do a PEO and not really have to think about it, but pay more. That's really kind of the decision you're making as a startup. \n\nSo, a lot of times it just depends on how much money you have and how strong a fundraiser the company is and how hot the market is and that kind of stuff. So, we are seeing PEOs take market share right now. So that seems to be a trend that a lot of startups are embracing. \n\nSo I hope that helps answer the question.

And today we're talking about one of my favorite new features on Rippling: it's automatic expense reimbursement for employees. \n\nSo, the typical reimbursement flow for an employee would be, you have to manually file an Expensify expense report, then someone like the CFO of the organization needs to review that, sign off on it and manually reimburse the employee. \n\nWith Rippling, they make that whole flow automatically, as long as there's a consistent reimbursement every month. So if you're reimbursing your employees, you know, $50 for a cell phone bill every month, or maybe a meal program or something like that, Rippling can actually do it automatically, and take all that manual labor out of it. \n\nWhen you start multiplying it by 30, 50, 100 employees, you're actually saving a lot of time. So that's why I'm really liking the new Rippling Automatic Employee Expense Reimbursement. It's a really cool feature. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\nLooking for advice setting up your startups HR, finance, and payroll infrastructure? Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about what to look for in a payroll system.\nSo the first thing is a simple, intuitive interface. You need to know actually how to work this thing and probably some of your team members need to know how to work it. So you do not want something super complicated so you don't have to spend a ton of time on the phone with support. \nThe next thing is you need to be able to run payroll on autopilot. There is literally, probably nothing worse for employee morale than when payroll is missed. They start asking questions, \"Does the company have enough money?\" \"Why was payroll missed?\" So you want autopilot. You need autopilot. It also saves you a lot of time and money with your accountants. There's no real reason to be paying your accountants to run payroll. You should be using a system that runs it automatically. \nNow, you also need the payroll system to handle tax information, specifically like state payroll tax information, really nicely. Many more companies are being remote now which means employees in many other states, so getting that information into the payroll system is super important. If it doesn't get in, your payroll gets blocked, you also start racking up penalties with the states for missed payroll tax payments. So it's super important that the system can handle that information and also, it's kind of obvious, but make the payroll tax payments to those states. Next, you really wanna have great customer service. \nNow, maybe this should have been number one, but having great customer service is so important, especially when you're getting into, like, M&A or a VC funding moment because sometimes during diligence, you need, like, a bunch of state payroll tax filings to show the opposite side's lawyer. Or you just need something that comes up and if you can't get on the phone with your payroll system provider, then you could be spinning your wheels and actually delay a fundraising. I'm old school. I like to talk on the phone. So I really appreciate it when firms have good support. \nAnd the other thing you wanna make sure is that your accounting partner has premium support. You do not want your accountant sitting there on hold charging for that time. You want them to get through right away. So premium support, they'll get the best customer service people. They won't waste a bunch of time on the phone and, odds are, your accountant is gonna be doing the work and fixing stuff for you anyways, not you. It's usually the accountant who does that kind of stuff.\nOne other thing you really wanna do is make sure that payroll provider can handle R&D tax credits. This is super important. Last year, Kruze saved our clients four and a half million dollars in payroll taxes by doing these credits. But the payroll system needs to be able to intake the forms and actually handle it and send it out to the IRS. And it's even better if they have a real-time credit. So there's some payroll systems that will, charge you a small fee, but they'll stop withholding right away so you get the benefit of the credit immediately. \nNow, there is a huge difference between good payroll providers and ones that can't get their act together on the R&D credits. And the ones that can't get their act together means our startups don't get their refund for a really long time. That's money that could be in your pocket, could be paying for another engineer or a sales person, that you're not getting simply because you picked an inferior payroll system. Do not make that mistake. Pick one of the ones that we recommend on our website. \nAnd finally, you want really strong HR reporting. You need to know who's in your organization. You need to be able to see PTO balances, sick leave balances. You need to be able to see who reports to who. You need to be able to sort things based on their title. All that kind of stuff becomes really important. If your payroll provider invests money in their HR reporting, it can make your life so much easier, make you accountant's life so much easier and save everybody money. And the final thing that you should be looking for is a really nice integration into QuickBooks. \nWhen those payroll journal entries come in automatically, it actually saves us a lot of time. And we love it when they're broken out by employee. That makes doing the R&D tax credit a lot easier. So make sure they have a good, clean integration with QuickBooks and you'll be all set. \nNow these are all the things to look for in a payroll provider. It's a lot, but it's actually one of the most important system decisions you're gonna make as a startup. So hopefully this helps help you make a really good decision. Thanks. Okay.",

And today we're talking about Rippling's automated and detailed payroll journal entries. \n\nSo one of the things we love about Rippling is they actually sink into QuickBooks really, really nicely. The entire payroll journal entry, like kind of the information and statistics, like how much people are paid actually come through Rippling into QuickBooks and make our life as a startup bookkeeper so much easier. So and the thing about Rippling is they've taken it to another level where they actually break out each employee. \n\nNow that's important because you actually want to know kind of what people are actually making. The variance between the people and also when they're getting raises or when they're getting bonuses. It's nice to know who got paid that bonus. In all the other systems there are some links, some automated things, but Rippling by far has the best integration and, just so you know, at Kruze for the other payroll platforms, we actually have to manually break out the payroll journal by person because it doesn't come across in the sync. \n\nSo that's one of the reasons we love Rippling. It saves us so much time. We've already built our own system to categorize 70 percent of transactions. So when we use Rippling as the payroll provider, we're knocking out another 15 percent of that. We're automating up to 85 percent. Which is incredibly powerful. \n\nSo thank you to the Rippling team. Thank you for those engineers at Rippling who spent a ton of time building that super awesome detailed automated sync for the payroll journals. We really appreciate your work. It's one of the reasons why we recommend Rippling. Thanks.",

Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHi, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about a hidden advantage of Rippling and that it's able to let you work with Independent Insurance Brokers. \n\nNow, one of the reasons I love working with Independent Insurance Brokers is that that's all they do. Their whole mission in life or professional life is to get you a great deal on your insurance. And it's how they make their money, it's how they build their reputation, it's how they get clients. \n\nSo they are very hungry and they are out there scouring all the best plans throughout the entire United States. Not just California, like Cal Choice or some of the New York plans. It is very important in this day and age and with remote and virtual working to have an insurance broker who can span all 50 States and figure out the best plans in the State. Otherwise, your out-of-the-state employees will end up spending a lot more and the company will end up spending a lot more because the plans are not competitive. \n\nSo Rippling enables Independent Insurance Agents. And this is pretty unique, most of the big HR payroll systems or PEOs, they want you to work with their independent brokers. And it's pretty simple. That is a way for them to make more money on every client and you can't blame them. That's part of their business model. That's how they operate. That's often how they can offer such great software for cheap. But, those insurance brokers are not as hungry as the independents. The independents just are. And the independents also often have a higher service offering. They'll get on the phone, they'll do presentations for your company. They'll ask your employees what they care about the most. \n\nSo I'm a huge fan of Independent Brokers and Rippling makes that available. You can actually use Rippling with Independent Brokers. That's not the case with most PEOs and other HR payroll systems. And you know, it can save your company a huge amount of money. I'm talking like 10 or 15% on the Annual Medical Benefits Premiums. So I hope this helps and I hope this little hidden advantage of Rippling helps you decide what Payroll and HR system to use. Thanks.",

Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about the biggest mistakes a startup can make when running payroll. \n\nNow, payroll is like one of those most sensitive things because A) Everyone likes to get paid who's working. And B) The IRS loves payroll taxes. Everyone focuses on the annual tax returns, but they really kind of make their money on payroll taxes. So they're laser focused on that. And guess what? The biggest mistake a startup makes is actually not running payroll through payroll. Meaning they just wrote the founders a check or  they wrote the first couple of employees a check without pushing it through payroll and taking out the withholding taxes. \n\nNow, this is a very common mistake. We have tons of companies doing this before they come to us and it creates a lot of problems. You think it's like a very easily fixable problem. But every time you have a quarter end and those payroll taxes were due or should've been paid, but the IRS didn't get them or didn't know about them, it creates a huge like just legacy of penalty notices and back taxes and paperwork for your poor accountant to figure out. So please sign up for Gusto. Sign up for Rippling. It's super easy.\n\nIt's super cheap. Run your first payroll through an actual payroll service. Withhold the taxes. It is insane the amount of paperwork and time it takes when you don't do that and you just pay someone with a check without actually submitting taxes. So that is by far the biggest mistake people make with their payroll. And we would love it if no startup ever came to us again without having done this, because it would make our life so much easier\nand it would save the startup so much time and money. \n\nThat little kind of original sin of just slipping a check to somebody without running it through payroll and withholding is a really big problem. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "How should Founders pay themselves?\n\nLooking for advice setting up your startups HR, finance, and payroll infrastructure? Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today I'm answering the question, \"How should a startup founder or CEO pay themselves?\" \n\nAnd this is actually a question surprisingly, we get quite a bit. So the main thing you want to do as a founder is you want to make sure you're on payroll, like you are an employee of the company. And the reason for that is the IRS really doesn't like it when founders who own a big equity percentage of a company list themselves and pay themselves as contractors. The IRS feels like you're trying to avoid paying payroll taxes in that scenario. And they know you own a lot of the company, and so they feel like you should be an employee of the company. \n\nAnd so you really want to comply with the IRS, so make sure you're an employee and make sure you run it through a payroll system, because the payroll taxes will be taken out of your paycheck and sent to the federal or state authority. So that way you'll be in compliance. It's so much easier. We see a lot of nightmare scenarios where founders just honestly just didn't know better, weren't working with an accounting firm like Kruze and didn't have anyone to ask, and they just started writing themselves checks out of the company bank account. And the IRS will pick up on that and see that money was leaving the company bank account and going to someone else with no taxes paid. And so you'll start that endless parade of payroll tax problems and penalty letters. \n\nAnd it's really not easy to repair those situations. You have to spend hours on the phone, on hold with the IRS. The payroll companies, although they're great to work with, they don't want to fix things that happened before you started working with them, and so they'll refuse to fix it. And Kruze can fix it, but it's really expensive. And frankly, it's work we don't really like. And so it's kind of like a lose-lose because the founder ends up paying a lot of money to fix this stuff and we don't enjoy it either. So just make sure you're on payroll, you're taking payroll taxes out, you're in compliance with the IRS. And as just a side note, a lot of founders ask us what they should be paid. We actually did a survey. We do this every year for founders and CEOs, how much they should be paying themselves. And as you can imagine, those numbers change as a company grows up. What founders at a seed stage company should be paying themselves is less than what a founder at a series B or series C. \n\nSo as you start raising more money and as your company starts getting a lot bigger, founders and CEOs typically pay themselves more. But we have a survey on Kruze's website. So Kruze with a K, K-R-U-Z-E, and just type in like CEO startup salary survey, something like that. This thing called Google's going to be pretty big and I think it'll help you find us. But it's a pretty informative survey, and we have over 300 clients. And so there's just a ton of data points. \n\nAnd, you know, one of the really great things we've seen on CEO and founder salaries is that women founders have actually achieved pay parity at most stages of startups. For a very long time, women founders were underpaid. And so we were very happy to report in 2020 that women founders, based on our data achieved payroll parity. Now, obviously there's a lot of challenges, other challenges being a woman CEO or someone who's an unrepresentative minority CEO, and there's things that don't show up, but we were really excited to see some of these trends going in the right direction. \n\nSo I hope this answers your question on how should a founder CEO be paid. And again, we have a lot of resources to help you make the right decision, do it correctly, and also just know what you should be paid. Hope that helps, thanks.",

Visit Kruze’s startup health tips resource: https://kruzeconsulting.com/five_tips_for_startup_financial_health\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And have a kind of a cool announcement here. Gusto said that they are now allowing startups to use their own independent insurance brokers to help find health benefits. \n\nSo this is a pretty big change here, actually from Gusto. So Gusto originally started off as a payroll company, and then they got into the health benefits and other kinds of benefits business, probably like three years ago. It's kind of a natural extension of the payroll product because people, when they normally sign up to pay payroll and hire employees, they're going to want to offer benefits and so that made a lot of sense. But Gusto basically kind of vertically integrated and had internal insurance brokers, picking the plans and trying to help startups decide what to do and what plans to be on and what carriers and all that kind of stuff. \n\nAnd so, there wasn't really an independent broker option, but if you've kind of been through the picking insurance traditionally, you know that insurance brokers actually can be really effective, especially when a company is remote or distributed and has people in a lot of different states. It really helps to have an expert who's really paying attention and frankly motivated to find the best plans for the startup. I know this because we went through this and we did exactly this, which we hired an independent insurance broker. \n\nThe broker picked some very specialized, awesome plans in some states that we were just getting totally gouged in, on our old plans. And we ended up saving $30,000 for the year. And that was when we were like, I think half the size or a quarter of the size we are now. And so those insurance brokers actually do really important work and can save your company a lot of money. And so I was really just excited that Gusto's offering this now, because I think it's also going to allow companies to stay on Gusto for longer. \n\nAnd no one really loves to switch payroll and benefits providers. But this was one of the triggers that was causing people or startups to leave Gusto, not being able to use an independent insurance broker. And so, bravo Gusto. I know this probably took a lot of engineering, a lot of work in the background and a lot of process. And at Kruze we're excited to help promote this and just let the world know that you don't have to move off of Gusto anymore to use an independent insurance broker. You can stay on Gusto and they can make it happen. \n\nSo, hope that helps. And hit us up if you have any questions or comments. Thanks. Hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com. Thanks.",

And today we're talking about re-outsourcing your startup's financials. It's kind of a interesting topic, and something I've been thinking about for a little bit. And it's helpful to kind of go back historically. \n\nBack in the day, startups didn't really hire a VP of finance until they had like kind of 40 or 50 people. The financials would be outsourced by a firm like Kruze, and same with the taxes. But then, and then they'd probably maybe start hiring like the accounting staff, like staff accountants, controllers, all that kind of stuff. Around 50 to 80 employees. And so it was, 'cause it's expensive, frankly, to employ a lot of accounting people. The strong accounting people are very expensive, as I know. And so what you saw in the last couple, maybe the last year mostly, was the fundraising climate got really frothy. There was a lot of capital around. And so you even saw series A companies raising like 20 million bucks. And so what happened, was we started seeing startups hiring a VP of finance at like number 20 employee, or number 25 employee, even number 30. And you're never gonna argue against bringing in financial talent in a company. \n\nThat's actually really good for the company. There's a lot of things they can do for the company even outside of financials. I always say a good VP of finance can actually become almost like a COO, too, for a startup. So very valuable people to have. And that's very helpful to the company, but what was kind of driving it on the cost side of the equation was, it was, those companies were raising so much money at such a high valuation, that they became kind of insensitive to the cost. It was almost like, \"Ah, we raised all this money. What else are we gonna do with it? Let's hire a finance person.\" And then the other change that started happening, was they immediately started moving pretty quickly into hiring internal accountants, like controllers and staff accountants. \n\nAnd, historically, at Kruze at least, we would always support a company for like at least a year, or we'd start reporting to that VP of finance, and then support the company for at least a year until they brought in, started hiring like one by one, those accounting hires. But we started seeing it happen a lot quicker. Again, just kind of that insensitivity to the cost, because the company had raised so much money. \n\nThe other thing, which is a very fair rationale was, if you're gonna triple your head count in a year, which many of our clients were projecting, then you do need a lot of infrastructure, and you do need those accounting professionals. 'Cause that's a lot going on, a lot of growth, a lot of transaction growth, expense growth, a lot of operations growth. And so that made sense. But as the markets start slowing down now with the NASDAQ, we're starting to see basically, like older clients getting in touch with us, and being like, \"Hey, is the shop still open? Can you pick up things?\" 'Cause I think what they're finding is that VP of finance is still really valuable, because again, they can do a lot of things with the company, other things besides just purely financials, but they're kind of realizing that maybe some of those accounting hires that are full-time, and benefits, and taxes, and all that kind of stuff, maybe aren't the bang for the buck that they thought it was, or they don't need that, or they're not gonna grow quite as fast, or maybe they're just more sensitive to making sure they preserve their capital. So it's early in this trend, we're just starting to see it. \n\nThis is being recorded in May, 2022. And the NASDAQ has just kind of, the decline in the NASDAQ's kind of hit a critical mass now, but it's been something that's been happening for the last month. And so I thought I'd just make a video on it, and put it out there.",

So these people may need to be employees, especially if you're, you know, working with a bunch of people in one country, that country, you know, governments really love payroll taxes. And so oftentimes if you're building a big presence and they can argue that you have tax nexus, you may end up having to put them on payroll. You can use a global PEO to do that, but that's really the first test. Make sure they're actually a contractor and they pass all those tests. \n\nNow, if they, if you have validated them as contractors, there's a couple really, really easy ways to pay them. My favorite personally is just using bill.com. I like bill.com because it allows you to upload the invoice the contractor gave you into bill.com and you can actually have some documentation, both for your own records and for your accountant. It makes booking all these contractor payments in the correct periods so much easier. \n\nAlso sometimes contractors are a little disorganized. They might try to double bill you or you pay them and they're complaining they never got the money, whatever it is. You can actually show the cash trail through bill.com and bill.com has international wires now so you can set all those, all that stuff up through bill.com. So that's the first option. Another option is paying your contractors just through the old fashioned bank wire. And in some countries that maybe don't have as developed banking systems, or maybe there's a high chance of fraud, then you do kind of, you do use a wire oftentimes, but that doesn't have the advantage of uploading the invoice and having that for a record, a couple other options are Rippling and Gusto. \n\nNow Gusto is steadily making progress on this. They've got Canadian international contractors can be paid. One thinks that they'll probably have, you know, the rest of the countries, international contractors being able to pay through there. Rippling does allow you to pay contractors globally, which is really, really nice. There's also a couple kind of contractor-centric companies like Deel which is a new company, which allows you to pay your contractors and foreign employees in one place. They kind of have like abstracted the global PEO and so it looks like one interface to you, but the payments can go through a PEO or they can go through a wire or a different channel, but it all looks the same to you, which is a pretty nice option. \n\nThe other ways of doing it are good old fashioned, PayPal. Like people use PayPal, TransferWise, things like that. And then finally, maybe, you know, depending on how you're thinking, but like things like Bitcoin or Square's Cash app can also be an option. We are careful about Bitcoin because when you make payments with Bitcoin, that is a, it's a currency that is moving around quite a bit.\nAnd so it makes the accounting a little bit harder, but if you only have a couple and they're the kind of people want to be paid in Bitcoin, that's an option as well. The key thing to remember is whatever way you choose the pay your contractors, you really need to have those invoices. The IRS requires you to keep three years of invoices at all times in case you're audited. And so you need it for that reason. You wanna make sure, it's gonna be impossible to track down these invoices if you're ever audited. \n\nAnd secondly, to make your accountant like Kruze, work a lot faster and keep your accounting bill down. If we have access to those invoices, we can see the period for which the expenses should be booked and therefore we do not need to bug you. We can also see if you're being double billed. We can see if there was a deposit already made. We can answer so many questions on your behalf for those contractors and save you a lot of time.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question, How does the right credit card make accounting easier? \n\nAnd as a business owner or founder of a startup, you should really care about making the accounting easy because that saves you a ton of money on your accounting. The easier the accounting is, the less your accountant has to charge. I know this from experience 'cause that's what we do. So the right credit card is really important because it can get all the data, all the transactional data like vendor, date, payment amount, even transaction description into QuickBooks so much easier. Getting that nice clean bank feed or credit card feed into QuickBooks saves your accountant a ton of time. \n\nNow especially us because we have set up and built a bunch of automations that plug into QuickBooks that recognize transactions automatically. So we're able to do about 70% of the transactions automatically now, which means a human accountant is not touching those transactions, which again saves you a lot of time and money. But we can only do that with some of the credit cards out there because some of them are on super antiquated systems and do not have clean bank feeds and are always needing to be reconnected into QuickBooks. \n\nThe other important thing for a credit card to make your accountant's life easier is that they have easy read-only access and log in access in their portal. I can not tell you how many times we have been locked out of American Express. It drives me bonkers how many times. It happens constantly. And if I feel really bad about it, because I have to call and email the founders and say, \"Guess what? We're locked out of American Express again.\" And it makes us look stupid, but really it's American Express or this happens with other credit card portals where we're getting locked out through no fault of our own. They're just built on bad technology, really kind of like 1980s, 1990 stuff, and are not built for portal access and multi-tenant access for like companies like us that serve hundreds of startups. They think you have one accountant for one company. That's how their systems are built. It's also why we love some of the newer credit card systems. \n\nSo we love Brex. That is probably our favorite. They make the integration with QuickBooks super easy. Our transaction automation runs on top of Brex very nicely. And even Brex has some of their own automation built into the connection with QuickBooks. So that's really nice. Stripe has come a long way with their credit card offering and they continue to get better. \n\nIn fact, we give them a lot of feedback on that. And Expensify has come out with their virtual credit card, which is really nice. So those are three that will really help solve problems for your accountants, which in turn makes your life as a founder easier. And by saving money that allows you to hire another engineer or another salesperson, maybe not pay for the whole salary of that person. 'Cause that would be a really huge saving. But every dollar counts in startups. \n\nAnd so having a really good credit card that syncs nicely with QuickBooks that plays nicely with our automation, that recognizes transactions and labels them automatically is really important, and has a good portal that can handle accountants who have hundreds of clients and not lock us out constantly. All save you time and money and they save us time and money and it keeps everybody happy. I hope that helps. Thanks.",

Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're talking about what is the best credit card for eCommerce companies. \n\nNow, eCommerce companies have some very special requirements. They're not your usual startup or bootstrap company. They are buying a ton of inventory on that credit card. So it's really important. They have a high limit. The higher the limit, the more inventory they can buy at one time on the credit card. That's helpful to everybody. The other thing they really care about is having a long float. \n\nNow, float is measured in days. Typically it's a 30 day float, but sometimes you can get 60 day floats. That's really helpful because that means you don't have to pay the credit card down for 60 days instead of 30 days. Very, very helpful. Another thing they care about is having really nice rewards. They're pushing a ton of purchases through that credit card. And so they want to get the rewards that come with that, trips, hotels, airlines, or even cash back. Those can all be very valuable if you're spending a lot of money on your credit card. \n\nNow, something that's not as important for an eCommerce company is employee spending limits. Typically, of course, they're gonna want to have a credit card for the employees to have spending limits on that. But the vast majority of the credit card spend for an eCommerce company is gonna be on that inventory purchase. And so it's kind of a nice to have instead of a must have. At least that's our opinion at Kruze Consulting.",

      "description": "The Benefits of American Express' New Startup Credit Cards\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're talking about American Express's new startup credit cards. So everyone thinks about American Express as like a big credit card company for big companies, or even like small businesses, and they haven't traditionally focused on startups, but that's changed. \n\nThey're actually coming out with a new credit card, and there's a lot of benefits for startups. So the first one is there's no personal liability. This has always been one of the biggest issues for me with startup credit cards. I hate to see when a company is going down, it's not gonna work out, I hate it when the founders might be saddled with a bunch of credit card debt, and so this takes care of that. That's like the biggest thing for me. No personal guarantee by the founders. \n\nNow, the other nice things about this is that it's a lot easier to use. American Express is actually coming out with virtual cards, so you can just provision employee cards really easily. And they don't even need to actually have a physical card. They just have the credit card number, and they buy their Dropbox or Box subscriptions, stuff like that, so it makes it a lot easier. It also works globally, so it's not just limited to the United States, which is really nice because a lot of companies, I know most of our customer base, are now remote and working throughout the globe, not just the United States. So there's some really nice benefits. \n\nNow, the rewards are really cool 'cause they're startup oriented. So they've got like the traditional Hilton Honors, hotel rewards that everyone who uses American Express really likes, but they also have some cool stuff around Uber rewards, CLEAR membership. And they even have like trip delay and flight cancellation insurance, which in this day and age, like, flights are getting canceled constantly. So if you are traveling, it is nice to have that backup. So, the rewards have actually gotten a lot better, and I think the cool thing about it is they become startup-centric rewards. Like, when things get back to normal, everyone's taking Uber everywhere, right? \n\nAnd so, that reward is actually really gonna pay off. Until then, you can still use the flight insurance, you can still use the hotel stuff. Now, the other thing about the American Express card is they actually have a cash back feature, which is super cool. So you can save up to 1.25% cash back. Every company isn't gonna save quite that much. Those are for kinda the bigger spenders, but getting like 1% back on your total Google and Facebook ad spend or all your web service spend, or if you're paying for your WeWork via credit card, these are like big dollar amounts coming back to the startup. And so, you can start to see how using the new American Express startup credit card can actually start mitigating your burn rate a little bit. \n\nNow, it's not gonna change your company and change your trajectory, but like every little dollar helps. And I always like to say like every dollar you save in perks like this can actually be redeployed to marketing or engineering, and so the American Express startup credit card is actually doing that. \n\nSo they have really good benefits, there's no personal guarantee, it's easy to use globally. I just think this is the credit card everyone should be paying attention to, especially for the cash back. Like, you put all those things together with the cash back, and all of a sudden, you have a winning credit card. So, I hope you check it out. Thanks, bye!",

      "description": "SVB Innovators Card\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn of Kruze Consulting, and today we're talking about Silicon Valley Bank's Innovator credit card. And oftentimes Silicon Valley Bank goes for short SVB. And really SVB has been the banking powerhouse of Silicon Valley for many, many years, dating back I think like 40 years. \n\nAnd really they bank a lot of the great startups in startup world, and they also bank a lot of the venture capital funds. So they are everywhere and it's really great that they have a new credit card that's competitive in the market. There was a time when there was some startup credit cards that were kind of a little bit more innovative and now SVB has caught up, and I think starting to surpass those other challenger banks and credit cards. And really, the benefits of the Innovator card is a couple of things. \n\nReally, the most important one is there's no personal liability for founders. For many years in some of the old-school credit card companies still require you as a founder to personally guarantee the credit card. So you're making no money 'cause you're a founder. And you're also having to put kind of all your assets on the line to guarantee this credit card. And that really can hurt you if the company goes down, especially very quickly and there's not enough money to pay off that credit card, that becomes your debt. And so that's one of my favorite things about the Silicon Valley Bank Innovator card. There's just no personal guarantee for the founders. \n\nThe other thing is there's no annual fee. We all kinda know that credit card companies love to fee you up and charge a fee every year. And that's one of the ways they make a lot of money. SVB does not do that. Now another benefit is you get kinda a single view of all your accounts. So in the SVB dashboard, they now have all your bank accounts, and they also have your Innovators credit card account, that didn't used to be like that. It used to be two separate things, almost like two software systems. Credit to SVB for investing a lot of money and a lot of time in technologically-innovative projects. They've acquired a couple of companies, but they really made their systems a lot stronger. \n\nAnd for accountants like Kruze, it just makes it a lot easier, a lot faster. And frankly, we can be more competitive on pricing when we work with an excellent bank that has good systems like SVB. So that's one of the reasons we recommend Silicon Valley Bank, they have a tremendous market share in the Kruze client base. There's a couple other little things like flexible spending limits. You can spin up someone's credit card really easily if you hire a new person. The money is taken out of your bank account to pay the credit card every month. \n\nSo they're gonna underwrite based on a big part of that without the personal guarantee. It's just underwriting based on your cash balance. So just know that if you have a really tight cash balance you may end up having to do a personal guarantee with a different kind of credit card than SVB or maybe somewhere else. But they're really looking at your cash balance in the bank to help underwrite this credit card. \n\nSo, really the Innovators card is just, I think it's one of the best offerings on the market and it really helps that it's coming from SVB. There's just a ton of synergies all over the place and it makes the path as you grow a heck of a lot easier. So check out the Innovators card. SVB has its own own website for that, just type in SVB Innovators card, and you'll get a ton of details. And if you wanna apply hit up SVB, or if you wanna ask some more questions about it, just hit us up at Kruze. Hope that helps, thanks.",

What do you need to know before you build your startup's financial model? There are three key things to think about before you start building your startup's financial model. \n\nOne: it's very important to know the goal of the model. Why are you doing this exercise? Are you just testing to see if your idea even makes sense? Are you getting ready to fundraise? Are you doing a budget? You want to use or customize and create the level of detail that matches with the type of model that you're trying to build. \n\nTwo: you really want to know the KPI's for your business and not just the financial ones but things like the number of clients you expect to have at different moments when you expect to release products or MVPs. And then three: you should use an existing simple financial model template. Like one of the free ones available on the Kruze Consulting website. Don't try to reinvent the wheel. There are many free templates available. Just grab one. \n\nHere are a couple of tips for you as you're building your startup's financial model. One: you'll want to pay very careful attention to your headcount projections and your payroll. Most of the early-stage startups burn is in payroll and in headcount. So, knowing this and understanding it is very important. \n\nAnd two: you should have a really strong opinion on the amount of revenue and the amount of cash burn that you'll have in the coming years in your financial model. And you'll want to make sure that the burn and the size are commensurate with the opportunity of the company that you're trying to build. Head over to our website and you can download one of our free financial model templates. Hope this helps.",

Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're doing a venture desk scouting report on Comerica Bank. Now, Comerica is a huge venture lending firm, they've been doing it for a very long time, dating all the way back to when they acquired Imperial Bank. A long time ago they built a really big venture lending business. There are some great people that work there, Sunita Patel is one of my favorites, John Benetti is one of my favorites, and Robert is one of my favorites. So those are three really great people to work with if you're doing a deal, especially if it's something creative, something big, those people love to get involved. Now, Comerica can do very large deals, it's a publicly traded company with a huge balance sheet. They can even do late stage, or even just before an IPO type of deal, so they're a great group to talk to if you need something, even on the small end, but especially on the big end. Now, like most banks, Comerica has a low cost to capital, and they have low warrant cover, so they're great to work with on an affordability basis, but you do have to remember they typically use a mature offers change, or investor abandonment clause, maybe some other convenance to limit their risk. That's very standard for bank lending, so just be aware of that when you get to the deal. Hope that helps, thanks.",

      "description": "The Rise of Smaller (but very meaningful) Startup Acquisitions\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and welcome to our YouTube channel. We'd be grateful if you'd subscribe, because we talk about tons of startup accounting, taxes, financing, VC stuff, on the channel. And today we're talking about the rise of smaller, but meaningful, startup acquisitions. And what we're seeing, this is actually like a real-time trend here. \n\nIt's actually pretty exciting. We're seeing a lot of seed stage or companies that raised like a seed plus extension round actually getting acquisition offers. We're recording this in August of 2022 and the NASDAQ's been down quite a bit. Getting a little bit of a summer recovery here. And what we're seeing is bigger companies are doing their bargain hunting. They're going around and they're looking for companies mostly that fill a technology gap and that have some traction. Something that is very synergistic with what they do in their normal course of business but that can be an accelerator. And so we're working on, this week, we just got three of these alone which are $25 to $45 million acquisitions for startups that only raised usually like kind of $3 to maybe $8 million in capital. So they haven't done the really big Series A, the $10, $15, $20 million Series A that puts your valuation probably in like the 50 to 80 zone. \n\nAnd the reason why these startups can entertain these acquisitions is that they haven't raised that much money. And these are good deals, not great deals, these are good deals for the VC Syndicate or the angels that invest in them. They're going to get a really nice return on capital. But what's really interesting is these are life-changing deals for the founders. If you've only raised, you know, 3 to 5 million bucks, you've probably only sold about 20 or 30% of your company. Therefore the management team owns 70 to 80%. 70% of 40 million bucks that's 28 million bucks. That's $28 million split amongst the management team. And most of these companies are run by kind of younger founders who, you know, don't have huge personal lives and personal expenditures. \n\nAlthough after these deals are done, they probably will upgrade their lifestyle a little bit. So this is very, very meaningful for them. It's going to be life-changing money and for their team and they get to put a win up on the scoreboard. That's something that oftentimes people underestimate. You know, when you get a nice win, you make some money for your investors, you set yourself up for life. The next startup is a lot easier to fund. And so there's all these different trends that are conspiring to, to yield these smaller but very meaningful acquisitions. \n\nSo I'm excited. This is all Kruze customer-base stuff and we're working on a bunch of them right now. And so I'm thrilled for these founders. They've worked super hard. Oftentimes, just because they haven't raised a lot of money, they've still been working on the company for three or four years. Oftentimes these are companies that maybe raised a million or 2 million. Got market traction then only raised like that extension round like I was talking about because they didn't quite want to raise a Series A. So still put a lot of time into the company, a lot of blood, sweat, and tears and so has the team. But it's very rewarding to see them cashing out and doing these acquisitions. And really it's really good for the acquirers, too. \n\nThis is like bread and butter acquisition. Like extending your product capabilities, adding another vertical you can sell into, doing something very synergistic in a downturn. Very smart acquisition ideas by the business development, corporate development teams at these bigger companies. \n\nSo kudos. And we'll leave you with that.

      "title": "Top 5 Quickbooks Alternatives Worth Considering for Your Business",
      "description": "Alternatives to Quickbooks\n\nIn this video, we talk about the top 5 Quickbooks alternatives that you may consider. While we primarily work with Quickbooks, reviewing some of the alternatives is still a good idea.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:38 Why Quickbooks is superior\n02:13 Xero\n03:33 NetSuite\n05:14 FreshBooks\n05:46 Wave\n06:14 Accounting Seed\n06:40 Excel/Google Sheets\n08:16 Closing Thoughts\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nThere are very few startups that are still using QuickBooks Desktop. There are some companies that have inventory that do use QuickBooks Desktop, but a lot of the plugins that handle inventory are progressing pretty rapidly for the QuickBooks Online Ecosystem. So even that's starting to change. But there are a couple of people who don't want to use QuickBooks. And, you know, personally and at Kruze we think QuickBooks is the superior piece of accounting software in the industry. And there's a few reasons why. It's really kind of industrial-strength, great security, never you know, very, very rarely goes down. It also has a huge ecosystem of other pieces of software that integrate into QuickBooks. And, you know, QuickBooks has made a lot of progress on the APIs, even Kruze like we've built a bunch of software internally that automatically categorizes transactions and pulls financial reports automatically. It does just a ton of other stuff. \n\nXero is probably the number one alternative for the smaller company segment. And Xero started in New Zealand it's actually a great company. I actually own stock in Xero. They are very, very strong in Australia and New Zealand, Asia, and some in the UK. And Xero was really the first cloud accounting software like truly cloud and that was a huge innovation. Actually, when Vanessa first started going to Kruze and I joined Kruze a couple of years later, we did do some Xero work. Sadly, we've never really been able to get a direct response to this, but it feels like there's different versions of Xero. And the United States version just doesn't feel like it has quite the horsepower, we've even had issues where data did disappear and that was a few years ago. I think Xero's gotten significantly better and you know, we're kind of a startup too. They've been investing in the product and making it better. They do have very good APIs. That is a strength of Xero. They have good API access. They were a real leader in that before QuickBooks kind of got their act together. \n\nAnd so we typically recommend QuickBooks up to that point. We have probably, you know 5% of our client base on NetSuite, we're very familiar with it. It is very powerful. One of the areas that NetSuite really excels for our client base is international consolidations. Like if you have a subsidiary in another country, that's kind of a pain in the butt to do with QuickBooks, you have to basically do a manual Excel, Google sheet consolidation. That means putting the two companies, the parent company and the subsidiary companies financials together. You have to do that through Excel. And that's a lot of work. It's not very easy. There's currency problems. NetSuite makes that very, very easy. So, and you know, eventually, the companies get so complicated that it's time for them to switch to NetSuite. \n\nNow there's a few other software companies like FreshBooks which is really great for independent contractors or super small businesses. It's basically, it's mostly, it started its life as an invoicing solution. And I actually worked with FreshBooks way back in the day before Kruze Consulting. Great company, great management team, huge commitment to customer service. They're famous for only letting the phone ring one time before someone picks it up. So if you're looking for that great customer service and you're a very small company maybe an independent contractor, FreshBooks can really work for you. Wave was another company we saw a little bit kind of back in the day, it's been kind of quiet on the Wave front now, but they actually entered the market as being free and then tried to monetize through some other avenues which actually works for them. I believe they were acquired, I have to confirm that, but they had a good exit, but it wasn't quite as powerful as QuickBooks. And, you know, once they were acquired, it made it kind of it wasn't like going to be the industry standard. \n\nThere's another company called Accounting Seed which is based on Salesforce, which I've seen once or twice. This is kind of one of those things where if you're using Accounting Seed, it probably works but you're probably also kind of limiting your pool of exceptional accountants that you can work with. So just be aware of that. It is built on top of Salesforce. It seems like, you know, a perfectly fine alternative. I haven't used it that much.",

      "title": "What Is a Cap Table & Why Does Your Startup CPA Firm Need One?",
      "description": "What Is a Cap Table? Cap tables explained in 3 minutes.\n\nIf you have been having trouble understanding cap tables, then you came to the right place. In this video, we discuss what a cap table is and why you need one every year.\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Ornat Kruze Consulting and today, I'm answering the question, why does your startup CPA need access to your cap table? \n\nThis is a question we get from founders sometimes because it's like sometimes the cap table is very precious and people, you know, when they're running a company don't want very many people know what the cap table looks like. Cap table, for those that don't know, is like the ownership percentages, breakdowns, and invested capital per investor, and it's tracked in what's called a cap table. Typically, your lawyers will manage your cap table. And typically, they'll use something like Carta, cap table management software, or they'll use like Excel spreadsheets for the early stage companies to just manage this. And so, sometimes, you know, the founders are like a little nervous about giving your CPA, like Kruze Consulting, access to it. \n\nBut there's actually a couple really good reasons. The first one is we actually reconcile the cap table, like the amount of money that each investor should have put in, to your equity accounts in QuickBooks, like your financial system, to make sure you actually capture all the money you were supposed to get. I did another video on this called, \"Reconciling the Cap Table\", but basically, the short version, and check that out, but the short version is like sometimes like wires bounce or investors don't send the money in or whatever it is, and you're short, and it's really embarrassing to just, to figure out you're short like a year later, and that investor has taken off, but that investor has also, you know, signed documents, and to go back to the board and be like, \"Yeah, guess what, we didn't get $250,000.\" You may like laugh watching this video, but like that happens, it happens, like once or twice a year. \n\nSo reconciling your cap table to your financial system is super important. Second one is, almost every tax agency needs us, your startup CPA firm, to actually do, provide breakdowns of ownership percentages for institutions and for specific shareholders, especially like the founders, large shareholders. And so it's not, and it's not just like your federal tax return, the people usually are like kind of comfortable with that, it's like, a lot of the state stuff, Delaware franchise tax need share counts, and then even some of the municipal stuff, you need to be able to provide share counts and who owns what, so getting access to that cap table is like actually really critical for your tax firm. \n\nNow, it's totally fine to do an export, you know, once a year, sometimes people do that, but Carta is actually better for us 'cause we can see the changes in real-time. Like a hypothetical problem could be like, maybe you export your cap table in October around a fundraise, but then you make a bunch of option grants or someone leaves and they weren't fully vested in December. Well, we want that December 31st year-end cap table 'cause that's what we're going to use to do all the tax filings and if we've only got the October version, that's potentially not accurate. So that's why we like Carta 'cause we can just look in real-time and see what it was on a certain date. So hope that helps, hope that answers your question. \n\nAgain, totally get that cap tables are sensitive and people want to be careful with that, but your startup CPA firm does need that for both reconciling and making sure you collected all the money you're supposed to collect from your investors and filling out all the tax forms.

The interesting thing about pre-seed is like maybe like five years ago all the VC funds, maybe 10 years ago, the VC funds started going upmarket. So traditional A, series A players, like all the famous Sand Hill Road funds wanted to kind of wait a little bit longer, and make sure the company was doing well before they gave them money, but they would give them more money, which then helped the seed funds emerge. And the seed funds used to be like the first check in and get things going, but then they started waiting a little longer and doing two or three or $4 million rounds. \n\nAnd so there was this glaring opportunity in the earliest stage possible, which is like the first check into a company. And some very smart fund managers decided to pursue this, and they branded it pre-seed, and it's been super successful. There's a lot of really good pre-seed funds now. We're actually seeing the pre-seed funds raise you know, they're, like $50 million funds now when they used to be like 10. So even they're growing. But for founders, this is really awesome because really pre-seed is there to like, the smallest check possible that can kind of get you going, and help you build something that can then prove out your idea. So some people call this product market fit, but I'd say it's even not product market fit. It's probably more like minimum viable product, like a simple SaaS solution that everyone can see, oh this is actually going to be helpful, or maybe get a couple customers to sign up for it. Or for like drug development, you find that you maybe can like actually start working on a compound. Or for health tech, you build like another minimum viable product that like a health system likes. So just like the very basic stuff. \n\nNow interestingly, pre-seed is really for kind of like, I kind of joke, it's for the non-famous non-repeat founders. And the reason for that is if you're like a famous founder, or already done an IPO, or been successful before, you're probably just going to go right to seed, or even right to series A, and just raise a big chunk of capital. And it's real simple, just kind of market demand, like VCs, everyone, angel investors, love backing founders that have done it before. Beause you just learn a lot on that roadmap, even founders that maybe weren't successful, they have sometimes an easier time raising money than first time founders 'cause they can talk about all the things they learned, and they know how to talk to investors, and have run board meetings and built something. \n\nAnd the reason for that is the valuation is just so low. But, the goal remember is to take as little money as possible that can let you prove out your idea. So we often at Kruze see pre-seed rounds being like $500K, a million bucks, something like that. And the valuation is usually like somewhere around $5 million, a little bit less, a little bit more, but so you're still kind of selling 10 or 20% of the business, which is a lot. That's a lot of dilution for, you know, a million dollars say. But again, this is kind of like for founders that really need that shot, and the seed or series A market isn't open to them. So you take the money, and the beautiful thing about taking that money, and you do suffer the dilution, but you're in business and you control your destiny. And if you build something awesome, then you are easily going to be able to get follow-on money. \n\n..................................................................................................................",

And today I'm answering the question, when should an early stage startup make its first operations hire? \n\nThis is an amazing moment in the startup's history because you are hiring someone who is not working on the product or selling the product. You're hiring someone to make the company actually function. This is, this is a beautiful moment. And a lot of people call this, like, including me, the Jack or Jill of all trades role. Like, this person is gonna have some HR background, maybe a little bookkeeping, finance background, and they're gonna be able to do a ton of different things, including recruiting, including office manager, all that stuff, some IT. You are looking for someone who is not afraid to dive in and figure something out. That's probably the most important trait for this entire job. \n\nAnd it's a really awesome moment. I typically recommend somewhere around 10 to 12 employees, is when I recommend hiring this person. I've had, you know, companies that hired this person the fifth or sixth person. In fact, one of my recent guests on my podcast, Founders and Friends, Leslie from Fleetsmith, she was a sixth employee. And I can tell you that company ran really smoothly because they had an operations hire really early. So sometimes you'll get some pushback. Oftentimes, I'm actually, or the Kruze people are actually the ones saying hire an operations person, because what tends to happen is the founder gets too busy. \n\nThere's too many people asking the founder questions, or trying to get their time, yada yada yada, and the company kind of like grinds to a halt, and things that need to get done don't get done because everyone's waiting on the founder to answer the question. And so the power of this ops person is A, they can answer a lot of those questions themselves, and B, they get time like weekly or every couple day one-on-ones with the founder to just rapid fire through these questions and get decisions made. And so it expedites everything in the organization. \n\nSo, the pushback I usually get is like, I don't wanna pay someone who's not gonna write software, or build a machine, or do research and biotech, or sell something and make us money. And my response is always like this person will just lubricate the inner workings of the company, and make it work so much better. It will help with company retention, like people retention. You'll get stuff done so much faster. All your service providers will be so much happier and do a better job for you, including Kruze. \n\nSo I am a big fan of hiring this position. And again, Jack or Jill of all trades, someone who's hungry, who's willing to learn a lot. There are a lot of people who just are serial ops people, who go from startup to startup, which I always have a lot of respect and admire them, because they do like two years at one company, and two years at the next company, and two years at the next company. And they build actually, like a pretty amazing portfolio of stock options. So, kudos to the folks out there who are doing this. Ops managers, we love you. And hopefully all the founders who are watching this video will listen to my advice, and hire at the latest around 10 or 12 employees. \n\nPlease make your company, invest in your company. Make it work a lot better, a lot smoother. And your team will be happier. Your service providers will be happier, and your customers will be happier. Hope that helps.

And today I'm answering the question could a 409A Valuation exceed a venture capital fund's valuation in a given startup? So it's kind of an interesting use case here. \n\nActually, I got a question from a friend when Stripe kind of reduced their 409A Valuation recently. And the 409A Valuation is there for stock option pricing, common stock. And VC investments are typically preferred stock, and preferred stock has usually like a lot of bells and whistles. They're actually pretty valuable, like liquidation preferences, where you get your money back, check out that video. There's also things where like the share class as a group can vote and block things like a sale of the company. \n\nAnd so typically, the 409A Valuation, the common stock valuation, is about 35% of what the preferred valuation is. So just very simply, if the preferred valuation was $10 million, the 409A Valuation would be like $3.5 million. So the 65% discount, it's 35% of whatever the company preferred is. And so you get these kind of interesting edge cases where like hey, could the 409A Valuation be higher? And the only two edge cases I could come up with, maybe someone will watch this video and actually correct me here, it would be kind of exciting, is two things. The first would be if the company did a preferred valuation in a down round, like the valuation went down all of a sudden, and it failed to update its 409A Valuation for a while, then I could see the 409A Valuation being higher. \n\nNow, technically, you only do the 409A Valuation so that you can issue stock options. So if you don't have a fresh 409A Valuation, you should not be issuing stock options. So in that case, the company that has the kind of old stale 409A Valuation that's higher than the preferred that's had a down round, they need to do a 409A Valuation pronto before they start issuing more stock options or repricing existing company options. \n\nSo that's use case one. The other edge case was, hey, maybe this company took a VC valuation like three or four years ago, pretty low valuation because it was three or four years ago and the company's building, and they're really kicking butt and they're doing awesome. In that case, the company would continue to do stock option grants, well, in that case, they would continue to do a 409A Valuation every 12 months 'cause that's how long they're good for and eventually, it's very possible that 409A Valuation could actually be higher than the preferred. In fact, if the company's doing really well, and it's contingent on not having raised more money. \n\nSo the last round was three or four years ago basically. Again, that can happen actually pretty easily. And so that's the use case that the normal use case, the legit use case that you might see around town if someone asks you those questions. \n\nSo I hope that helps. Again, pretty rare and if you're working on a company that's 409A is way higher than its preferred because the company hasn't had to raise very much money, it's kicking butt, well, hey, kudos to you. That's a good company and hopefully, your accounting company is Kruze Consulting. Hopefully we're working with you, too. So that ends this video.

So you know, you go to the VC firm, they give you a term sheet for $10 million investment, and that $10 million investment, the transfer of that is preferred shares usually. And the VC ownership has bought $10 million worth of primary shares. And so, that's typically how companies raise money. Of course, they can raise debt, things like that, but in terms of raising equity capital, they are selling primary shares. Now, the other thing that's happened lately is, especially in Q4 2021 and Q1 2022, it was a very frothy financial market for startups, and so a lot of companies were doing secondary sales. And secondary sales are either, basically existing owners of shares. So the venture capital firms, maybe the angel investors and management teams actually selling portions of their ownership, and the capital that comes from buying those shares, guess what, goes into their bank accounts. Not the company's bank account. \n\nSo, the company is not getting the proceeds from the secondary shares. Now, sometimes primary and secondary's are done together, especially when like a VC fund wants to get more ownership. Maybe they can only get 10% ownership in the startup through primary shares, and maybe some of the insiders say, you know, we'll sell a couple more percentages and they can buy some secondary and get like 15%. So, the combo approach is a way for VCs to optimize for more ownership, but they have to be okay with insiders like management and the other VCs taking some cash, some return off the table, and that's the trade-off. \n\nNow, the reason why we're covering this is the market's gotten pretty tough lately. We're recording this in late June, 2022, and a lot of companies are looking around, saying like, boy, I wish we would've raised more primary, like more capital through primary sales, like cash that can go on our company's balance sheet, instead of doing some of those secondary sales. Now, of course, there's always a conflict for management and maybe even sometimes the VC firms who are sitting on the board because they may have done a big secondary, taking some cash off the table, so they benefited personally from that. But now the company's in a weaker position. \n\nSo, secondary sales are just a fact of life in the startup ecosystem. I think they're going to kind of slow down now, but they were, you know, in Q4 2021 and Q1 2022, a really, really big part of the fundraising market. So I just wanted to explain the difference between those because people get confused about it quite often.

This is going to make all the founders who use Carta, their life so much easier. 83B filings and forgetting to send them in, in the first 30 days is like one of the worst things that you can do as a budding entrepreneur. Sometimes I joke it's like an IQ test. But really, there's a lot of smart people who have started a kick ass company, who just maybe were a little disorganized or whatever, didn't get the message from the lawyer, and forgot to send in their 83B filing. Part of the reason they forget, talked to many founders who have done this over the years, is they have like, they print out all the forms, sign everything, and it's sitting in an envelope that never got into the mail and certified to go to the IRS. \n\nSo Carta is going to make this so much easier for all of us. So first quick, 83B is what you basically fill out when you do like an early exercise of your stock options, or like for founder stock you buy all your founder stock at the point of incorporation. And what that does is, it basically locks in your tax basis and the taxes that you will pay going forward in the future are taxed at the capital gains rate instead of the income tax like regular income, ordinary income rate. So very important to do when stock options are a little more complicated than founder stock. Founder stock usually comes, you buy it like at par value, which is like 0.0001. \n\nSo almost nothing. A founder stock check to exercise early would be like a hundred dollars. Stock option checks to exercise early can be lots of money, especially if you're coming into a startup a little late, but a lot of times people want to do this. They have to be educated with all the tax consequences and all that kind of stuff, but sometimes people do this. And when you do that, you have to send the IRS, the 83B form. You also need to certify that for mail, so that you can prove to them you did send it in. \n\nThe last thing you want to do is like not certify it. They lost the piece of paper on accident, five years from now your company goes IPO, and you can't prove that you did the early exercise, right? So what Carta has done is basically introduce the capability to do this through the Carta platform. Now it still needs to be mailed in. This is kind of really cool what they're doing. They basically allow you to click through and sign all the documentation. And then guess what? Through the magic of probably some really cool API, Carta will actually send it to the IRS. I believe they include two copies of it. They include a cover letter in the envelope, and they will actually give you a tracking number that you can follow online through the Carta portal. They'll give you a tracking number that you can follow online through the portal and make sure it actually gets to the IRS. So they're taking this like, very offline manual process. \n\nThat again, is a real pain, and that people forget to do, and making it super easy to do via Carta. Again, by the way I forgot to mention that in the Carta platform, not everyone wants to early exercise all their options, because again, there can be a pretty big tax bill for that. And so they actually allow you to type in like how many shares or how many of your options you actually want early exercise, same thing on founder shares. So there's some variability, there's some controls you can actually just do whatever you feel like doing. You can do it multiple times if you want. But I just wanted to record this video so that all of us in the startup ecosystem can rest easy, knowing that 83B filings are going to be so much easier going forward.",

Should SAAS companies absorb sales tax or make customers pay it?\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:10 Paying sales tax explained\n02:40 Conclusion\n\n***********************************\nAdditional Resources\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXp906dsKgo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3bj-SFM0zI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIE-_QppwI\n\n***********************************\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits.

I actually did like a straw poll on this one at Kruze, because this is a question we get a decent amount. Everyone was pretty much like yeah, add it to the customer's bill. Customers should be paying sales tax if you're going to collect it. So just add it on top. There's a bunch of great systems, like Avalara, TaxJar, which was acquired by Stripe. I think there's a couple of VC-funded ones that will actually do the calculations for you and actually even look at which state their customers are in if you collect that data. And side note, please collect that data. We, Kruze, needs to know where your customers are so we can do nexus determinations. So super important to know where your customers are located. But these sales tax software engines will actually calculate it for you and just add it on top. \n\nSo very, very powerful, super smart to do that. We do have some companies sometimes. It's like they'll absorb it themselves for a little while, and I think it's just rooted in like hey, all of a sudden we're collecting revenue at material amounts, and we don't really know what to do, and don't know how our clients will respond and things like that but like it's one of those signs of a maturing company. You're just leaving a lot of cash, a lot of money on the table by paying for those sales taxes yourselves, and the customers are going to expect it, especially if you're like a certain size. So I would just go ahead and cut over, just start doing it, and it'll save you a lot of money 'cause you don't really want to pay your customers' taxes. It'll also help you get compliant, make sure you're doing all your stuff correctly. One warning. \n\nPlease do not forget to remit the taxes you collect to the government, like mostly state agencies is where it's going to be. It's like a very serious crime to collect sales tax and not remit. So occasionally, we see companies like in onboarding, they've been collecting sales tax for six months and never sent the checks into the gov and that's a recipe for some serious financial penalties, and even worse potentially. So if you're collecting sales tax, send it in. Do not sit on that money. Do not co-mingle it. Just get that money out of your bank account and into the government's bank account, and they will be happy, and they will leave you alone. \n\nSo I hope this helps. It's always an exciting moment when a SaaS company is big enough to even worry about sales tax. There's thresholds you've got to meet and I've done a video on that too. You check that out. Or you can check out the Kruze sales tax page. But yeah, this is cool. This is like your company's growing up. I'm very happy for ya.

      "title": "Ways To Cut Your Startup’s Cash Burn Rate On A Budget!",
      "description": "If you are a business owner, may it be a startup or an established company, you should know by now the importance of determining the burn rate. A company’s cash burn rate, to put it simply, refers to the company’s cash consumption over time.\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts \n\nBasically, runway is defined as your total cash in your bank account, divided by your average monthly spend. And that's how many months you have left. And so right now, we're recording this in July, 2022. There's a lot of startups that are stretching, making changes, making sure they extend their runway, ideally out to 18 months, something like that. And so, hey, I thought I'd give you a couple quick ideas. \n\nNext up, cutting the snacks in the office, all that kind of stuff, if you are even working in an office, a lot of companies are working remote these days. But it's not fun to do, it's kind of unpopular, but it also has the side benefit of sending a message to the team that, hey, we don't want to do this, but it's something necessary. We all have to save a little bit and look for cost savings opportunities. So it's not just the money you save with cutting the snacks and food and all that kind of stuff. But it's actually the subconscious or conscious message you're sending to folks. Another one which I really hate to recommend, but it is something to do if you're finding yourself in trouble and really need to extend your runway, which is, either cut back or fire your PR firm. if you don't have revenue.  \n\nNow, another thing to think about with cutting your burn rate is, about 70 percent, maybe 75 percent of most startups' costs are people costs. I'm talking salary, benefits, all that kind of stuff. And so I hate to say it, but one of the ways you can extend your runway is by either reducing head count, or you can do a 10 or 20 percent pay cut across the board.  \n\nAnd so you want to be careful here because cutting 10 or 20 percent of everyone's salary might scare a lot of people, so the strongest people may actually leave. They also may feel like they're being targeted, despite all the value they create for your company. And really, at the end of the day, personnel people, that usually is the most, kind of the intellectual power and where the company's going to go. Those people are really what drive everything so you've got to be really careful. I prefer to also do, or instead of doing that, do a check-in with each VP and just talk to them about performance. \n\nAnother thing, by the way, if you haven't taken venture debt, that's another really good way of extending your runway. Lenders love following the top-tier VCs into startups that are doing well, that have traction, who just need three to six more months of runway, so that's a really good opportunity. We have tons of content on venture debt so just Google Kruze venture debt and you'll find all of our videos and webpage on that. Something else to do, this is just an exercise I like to do every month in the Kruze financials, is, I just go through our general ledger and for any accountant worth their salt should be sending you your income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, supporting documentation like rev rec schedules, prepay schedule, balance sheet schedules, all that stuff, and general ledger. \n\nAnother way of looking at things, also, you find SaaS subscriptions there that you unsubscribed a year ago, but they kept billing you, stuff like that. Another thing you can do is look at a variance analysis. In our financial package, we provide a variance analysis. You can see chart of account categories, like web services or travel or office expenses, you can see them fluctuate. And those fluctuations will often allow you to see a cost savings opportunity, so I really like that. This is something we're starting to see now at Kruze quite a bit, which is people re-outsourcing their accounting. I did another video on this, so just put into YouTube re-outsource your accounting, or something like that, with Kruze in it. \n\nAnd ideally you're walking through that with a financial advisor, at Kruze, of course, we do that, but maybe it's someone internal at your company or just a friend, someone who's very financially savvy and wants to help your startup succeed and just spends a little bit of time with you every month. So budget to actuals can be your friend, big time. \n\nSo I hope that helps, there's a lot of ideas on how to cut burn. If you're a startup, this is a question we get a lot right now. Unfortunately it's a tougher time in the market and so hopefully these ideas help. If you have other questions on this or extending your runway, or budget to actuals, financial models, hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com, and please subscribe to our YouTube video. Thank you so much.",

The Fed just raised their interest rates up to 2.5%, so it's another 75 basis points. That means the prime rate has gone up to 5.5%. I can't even remember the last time prime was at 5.5. That's what banks lend at. And so for startups that have a lot of money, this is an opportunity. You're sitting on a bunch of cash. All of a sudden you can generate yield out of your cash and you can still do it, which is most important, in a safe way. That safety, if my top three criteria were different things, safety would be all three of those, frankly. You're getting money from the venture capitalists to build your company and take over the world. \n\nNot to speculate on interest rates or anything else, so safe. But nowadays Money Market Funds are actually starting to yield about 2%. That's meaningful. If you've got 20 million bucks in cash sitting in the bank, you can get a nice chunk of cash just by putting the money in a Money Market Fund. So what are the big things you should be doing? So, first of all, Money Market Funds, especially ones that have daily liquidity, that is a very important caveat. You don't want to be locked up in a Money Market Fund for a long time. You would like daily liquidity. That means you can just pull your money out whenever you want on a daily basis. And odds are, you would never pull all your money out at one time, but you might need to just fund the operating cash account, which is another video we've done here, for three months, which is what we recommend. But if there was an emergency you could pull your money out. That's very, very important. \n\nThe other thing that people often do is they buy what's called bond ladders. With bond ladders, and you get a slightly higher yield on this, you basically just buy US Government bonds, Google bonds, Starbucks bonds, stuff that's really, really safe, but you go out on the maturity curve, meaning you'll buy a set of bonds that mature in three months, in six months, nine months, 12 months, 15 months, right? So you're stretching out your maturity basically to match when you're actually going to need that cash flow, and again, you can get slightly higher yields that way, but you're buying direct securities. \n\nWell, with interest rates going up, you want to be really careful on your bond ladders and you want to stick to shorter maturities. You don't want that money locked up for anything past probably six months. You don't want it to go out to 12 or 18 months, and the reason why is, interest rates are predicted to go up even more. The Federal Reserve was talking after this last meeting about maybe taking interest rates up another 75 basis points. Well, if that happens and you're stuck in these bonds that you bought, you have to hold them to maturity, or you're going to incur a loss when you try to sell those bonds. The reason is bonds that pay a certain interest rate, when interest rates in the market go up beyond that those bonds are actually worth less. \n\nThey start to sell at a discount. They sell at a discount to compensate the new buyers and get them what the market interest rate is. And so you could end up putting a bunch of your money in a 12 month bond, have interest rates go up even more now, and all of a sudden you're selling those at a pretty hefty discount and you're actually losing money. No one wants you to lose money on your cash management. Again, we're talking safety here. So if you're going to do bond ladders, stick to three month bond ladders, maybe six month, at the max, bond ladders in this current environment.",

      "description": "In this video, you’ll learn about VC fund reserves are a portion of each fund that the VC firm holds back for second and third checks. These reserves are used to support startups that are operating satisfactorily but could use a little more money. And to wager twice as much on the winners.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:10 What are VC fund reserves?\n01:18 Situation of reserves\n02:17 Capital raise\n03:15 Conclusion\n\n***********************************\nAdditional Resources\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYn4xNVjirw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvlNASWzO28\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1jhmmPbjOU\n\n***********************************\n\nDoes your VC-backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections?

And today we're talking about what are VC fund reserves? \n\nAnd this is really important right now, because a lot of venture capital-backed startups are going back to their investors and asking for more money. Markets got a lot tougher, the NASDAQ has corrected. A lot of public tech stocks are down 50 to 60%. So it's a very tough market out there. And so, if you're a founder, one of the easiest, fastest, most convenient places to get more capital is from your existing investors, but guess what? They have to fund you out of their reserves. And so, let's walk through the mechanics of VC fund reserves. First of all, when a VC fund makes investments in a startup they almost always will reserve some percentage of capital to follow on. And there's two reasons for that. \n\nA, they want to support companies that are doing really well. It's really good to dollar cost average in even if it's a higher valuation in the future, because typically, if the company's raising more and more money at higher and higher valuations, it's a winner. And so, you want to keep getting as much capital into those companies as possible if you're a VC and you're maintaining your pro-rata ownership percentage, which you worked really hard to get. \n\nThe second situation you're going to use those reserves is you are going to fund a company that's not struggling or dying, but a company that's doing okay, but needs to hit, either a funding milestone, like maybe they need a couple more customers or they need to get the product out the door, or a company that's been out there for a while that needs to be bridged to an exit. So if you're a VC and the company only needs 3 or 4 more months of capital to get bought you get either make some money or get your capital back, that's actually a pretty good situation to put more money into the company. It's not optimal. \n\nAgain, they always want to be putting more and more capital into the winners. But if you're bridging to an exit, that's another place where VCs will pony up and give you some of the reserves. So most VC funds kind of there's no hard and fast rule, but most maintain 30 to 40% of the fund to be reserved. So if you think about that, 60 to 70% of the capital say they raise a $500 million fund, 60 to 70% of that is going to new capital, new companies. \n\nSo that's 300 to 350 million of the 500. And then you've got another couple hundred million give or take, that will go in and support those portfolio companies. So that's how VC funds work. Now, there's a lot more scrutiny the next time you come back for more capital, if you're not like a rocket ship and kicking butt. So it's super-important to treat this almost like a new investment when you're asking the VCs. You very likely will have to pitch the partnership again, you'll very likely have to, you'll kind of have to realize that you're using one of your chips. \n\nThis may be, if it's a bridge situation, the last time you can ask the VC fund for more capital. After this, you're on your own. It's very hard to continue to fund a company 3 or 4 times, if good things aren't happening and new capital isn't coming into the company. So VC fund reserves are very precious. The partners, they don't get to do it usually in every one of their companies. So they are having to pick and choose how many companies out of their own portfolio they can support, how many of the general partnership they can support.",

CDs, for the humans out there who can remember high interest rates. So certificates of deposits are a savings vehicle where you actually give the bank your money, and then you get a certificate of deposit. You get like a claim ticket basically. The bank has your money for a set period of time. Typically a fixed interest rate, although they can float, but most banks always want to do fixed. And oftentimes, this was like a major investment vehicle in like the eighties and seventies, when interest rates were like way higher, because hey, it's like super safe. It's insured up to $250,000 at the bank. And so, all of a sudden you're getting like, you know, if interest rates are high, you're getting like 10% just by sitting there in a riskless investment. \n\nThat's actually really, really good. And so for a long time, or the last like 5-10 years, interest rates have been really low. Banks have paid very low interest rates. Certificates of deposits weren't that interesting, except for people who really really wanted super-secure cash. Well, guess what? Startups actually want super-secure cash. Like, the VCs gave you the money not to like go speculating on, you know, interest rates, but to build your company, change the world, hire a lot of people, et cetera. And so certificate of deposits actually, and the fact that there can be variable times, like you set the time depending on what works for you, you know, three months, six months, a year, two years. They're actually like a pretty decent match for startup cash management. What you'll see for a lot of startup cash management is either money goes in like a money market fund that essentially holds certificate of deposits and bonds. \n\nOr if companies have like a lot of cash, they will start buying these things directly. And that's what I'm starting to see now is companies, and that's why we're doing this video, companies that have a lot of cash are starting to see like, hey, you know, I can put this money, excess money that I'm not going to need for like a year, I can put it in a six month CD, and actually earn a decent amount of yield. I know it's safe. I don't have to worry. I'm not going to get fired by the board for putting it into something risky. And I'm getting a higher yield because I'm agreeing to lock that money up for six months. \n\nAnd so that's why we're recording this. 'Cause we are seeing startups put money into certificate of deposits, like decent, like happening a decent amount nowadays, way more than it used to happen even like a year ago, when interest rates were way lower. 'Cause back then, the yield was like so minimal. It didn't really make any sense to lock up. But as interest rates have gone up in the economy, I think prime, when I'm recording this, is like 4.75 now. And I think it's due to go up like another 75 basis points. Like we're talking real cash if you lock up the money in a safe instrument at a bank, like a certificate of deposit. So, check around, shop around, your bank that you bank with, startup bank, will probably have a certificate of deposit. \n\nAgain, a lot of the startup banks interestingly, are still swimming in cash, and are paying very low yields, because those banks, because they hold the cash for the whole startup ecosystem, like SVB, First Republic, et cetera, Bridge Bank, Comerica, Mercury. They are not going to pay very much yield because they don't really need to attract more deposits to facilitate their lending.",

And today I'm just sharing how to add your accounting or CPA firm to Carta. \n\nMost startups that we work with are on Carta these days. We've been very fortunate. We have a great relationship with the company. Vanessa and I always think fondly back to Henry Ward's emails and calling on us when I think Carta was a five person company and we were probably four people, so long, long history there. And then also, if you have a little extra time, I did a really good podcast with Charlie, the CFO at Carta last year so check that out. But for accounting and CPA firms, you really need access to Carta because that's where the CAP table lives, and it's not always the most intuitive thing. \n\nSo we just want to make this quick little video to help all the Kruze clients out there and really anyone in the startup ecosystem who's trying to figure out how to do it. So step one, obviously, you're going to log into Carta. If you can't do that, you're probably in trouble. Next one you're going to do is actually navigate to the company tab, and then you're going to click permissions and roles. This is really important. Then, this is counterintuitive if you're looking for your CPA or accounting firm, click the law firms button or link, and then click add law firm. And then of course, if you're a Kruze client watching this you're just going to type in Kruze Consulting and voila, Kruze will be added to read-only view. \n\nKruze team will be able to see your CAP table, and when we're doing all the tax returns and some of the personal tax filings like 3921s, things like that, it will make our life a lot easier. It'll make your CPA's life a lot easier if you're not working with Kruze. Now, you're kind of sitting there going why a law firm? Well, it's just the way Carta has established this. I think they probably built this for law firms in the first place. Law firms were actually the main channel I think Carta expanded through in the early days because lawyers always control the CAP table. Really they still do control the CAP table. Carta's just a better piece of software versus Excel, right, where there can be document control problems. \n\nSo that's why it's labeled law firm, but it's all good, folks at Carta, we know how to do it, and now everyone watching this video also knows how to do it. So if you have any other questions on CAP tables or 409A Valuations or access points for other important tools in the startup accounting ecosystem hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com, and thanks Carta for your partnership all these years, and looking forward to many more going forward. \n\nThanks so much. Also I forgot, please click subscribe, and check out the rest of our channel. We put a lot of time and effort into our YouTube channel, so we'd appreciate it if you spend a little bit more time and check out some videos. Thanks so much, bye.",

This is important stuff, seed rounds are usually like the first material amount of money into a company, and you want to do things right when you raise that institutional investor money. \n\nSo the first thing you should do is develop a cash management policy. Like super important, be very clear about where you're keeping the excess cash, because you're going to keep some of the money in an operating account, some of the money in like a money market savings investment account. \n\nJust do a quick cash management policy that the board can ratify. There's templates all around the internet, just Google for that. The next thing you want to do is set up a corporate credit card, if you've been using your personal card. Now it is not okay to use your personal card. Obviously sometimes you're going to do this a little bit and submit an expense report, but you want to be professional, you don't want to be tempted by fraud, so set up a corporate credit card program. Next thing up, get a good accountant. Yes, of course the fine folks at Kruze Consulting CPA are available to do this. But actually having an accountant allows you to buy back some of your own time. You're not going to have to do the accounting yourself anymore. \n\nAlso important, you have a second set of eyes. So there's a little bit of like separation of duties, which again reduces the threat of fraud. Just make sure your financials are accurate so that you can report good burn rate statistics to your board. You also want to get on QuickBooks, like that's what all the best accounting firms use. And the great thing about QuickBooks is it integrates with all the new SaaS financial tools. So you kind of get the best of both worlds using QuickBooks. Another thing you are going to want to do is tune up your financial model. You probably had some sort of financial model when you're raising, if not, now's the time to build one. But just spend a little bit extra time projecting out next couple years in your financial model. Another thing you're going to want to do is have budget to actuals. I love budget to actuals, it tells me exactly where we're overspending and underspending, great for communication with the board. Super, super powerful. So budget to actuals are your friend. \n\nAnother thing that a lot of companies just don't do is send your investors a monthly update. Prefer to be early in the month, like maybe the 15th of the month, something like that, but just give them an update on what's going on with the company. This is really important because I see companies that have been silent for a long time, all of a sudden they're in a crisis or maybe they're short on money, and they go back to their investors asking for more money quickly, and the investors don't have any context. Also the investors can't help you, like these people all invested in your company so they can help you out. And if they're not part of the journey, they're not going to be able to help you out as easily as they could have if they were just part of the journey and knew exactly what was going on. Final little tip, hire a recruiter/contract with a recruiter, get someone in place who could start helping you build your team. We see something like 70, 75% of all venture capital raised goes to salaries and contractors.",

Of course there's like individuals, but the bulk of the money are the big LPs. And those groups, the funds, institutions, pension funds, keep their money in the stock market, in bond markets, and other alternative investments. And so anytime they get a capital call, meaning they get a request to fund the venture capital partnership, well, they have to usually sell something. And so they're selling their stocks, or they're selling their bonds, or doing whatever. They don't keep like a ton of cash on hand, they want to be as invested as possible. \n\nAnd so when the market has corrected and it's a really huge down market in the stock market and the bond market like it is right now, well guess what? Those institutions are selling at what they think is an undervalued price to fund the venture capital fund. And so they're kind of like, hmm, they don't really like doing that. Now part of being a good LP is always hitting your capital calls. And there's also like a lot of legal and financial incentives for them to never miss a capital call, especially reputationally. \n\nSo they're going to do it, but that doesn't mean they necessarily like it. And the other thing they really hate is when you do rapid fire capital calls in a tough market, and I'll never forget, I was working at Lighthouse back in the day in 2008, 2009, it was a venture capital fund, and we did something like three capital calls in five months or six months. And 2008, 2009 was when Lehman was going down and the stock market got crushed. \n\nAnd boy, did we get some grief from our limited partners? Now they all hit the capital calls, everything was fine, and we actually invested that money in some really amazing startups. So it was a great time to do investments, because the market was down, and that fund returned really, really well. So in the end, the limited partners are happy they did it, but they're definitely going to give you some grief and not be happy about it. \n\nSo you want to be smart about your capital calls, you want to be strategic about them, don't overwhelm them with rapid fire capital calls. Sometimes that just means a VC fund has to pass on some of the investments they want to do or be a little bit more judicious about it. That said, you know, VC funds make all their money in tough markets. Like when you can invest at a much lower valuation, that means your return expectations are going to be much higher when things normalize. \n\nSo don't be shy, you know, do those capital calls, I get some personal ones. I'm a very, very small investor in a couple funds, and I always make sure to send that money in to make sure I'm satisfying my legal obligations, my financial obligations, and of course, my reputational obligations. So hope that helps.

And today, I'm answering the question, what is a VC fund capital call? \n\nAnd so, as a refresher, VC funds raise money from big endowments, foundations, pension funds, and they essentially like draw down the capital, almost like a bank line, you just make a request of your LPs to send money into the funds bank accounts, and that money is then used to invest in startups. So everyone's got a boss and everyone's got someone they are raising money from in the ecosystem. And for VC funds, they're raising it from these big institutions. And so, when they essentially close the fund, like all the paperwork assigned, oftentimes VC funds will do something like, do a 10% draw down on the total commitment. \n\nSo maybe a pension fund commits a hundred million dollars to a new VC fund and, at closing, the VC fund will send a capital call notice to that pension fund for 10%, $10 million of that $100 million dollars. And they'll do that for all their limited partners. And so, they'll amass a decent size amount of money in their bank account, the funds bank account, and then over the next six months or so, they will proceed to invest that money in startups. This is what they do, they invest money, they buy ownership, and they hope that company gets more valuable over time. And so, the VC capital calls tend to be kind of like 10%, 15% increments. \n\nSo using my example before, once that 10% initial capital call is almost all used up, they'll issue another capital call notice and that capital call notice will have the bank wiring information for the fund, it'll say how much they're calling. Oftentimes, it'll also say how much of the commitment by that individual investor institution has already been called. So the investor institution kind of knows like, okay, I've already funded like 20% or 50% of my total commitment this fund so I can do some cash planning. So that's how it works. \n\nAnd then the VC fund will just continually invest the money and then do more capital calls. Now note, there's typically like you have like a 10 day or 30 day window to hit the capital call, like once you get the notice to fund the investment, that's all explained in the fund documents that all the LPs agree to. And the VC funds, again, want to be strategic, they don't want to do like rapid fire capital calls, like every two months or every month, they're doing a capital call. So they'll tend to spread it out. They do want to minimize what is called cash drag, which is doing too big of a capital call, having that money sitting in the bank account, earning very little interest, very little return, and then deploying it too slowly. \n\nAnd so, that can actually hurt a fund's returns because all venture capital funds are judged on both a multiple of capital they return and the IRR like the return interest rate, basically the internal rate return of the proceeds they generate. So a VC fund doesn't really want to have a ton of cash sitting on the balance sheet in their bank account. They want to have enough where they can comfortably make investments, where the LPs have good planning and have good visibility, know exactly when those capital calls are going to come, and then they want to have a smooth mechanical process, typically run by the fund accountants who are going to message all the LPs and ask for the commitments or the percentage of commitments that they should be getting. \n\nSo I hope that helps, we also have some really good videos around like LP behavior and why LPs hate capital calls in a tough market.",

This is a question we get a lot. \n\nA lot of our clients have people, employees, going through all out the country, and they're selling throughout the country. So this is a really important issue for people. So the basic of tax nexus is the relationship between a taxing authority and a business. And the way it goes is a business has to have tax nexus before it can be taxed. And so there's a couple different types of thresholds to establishing tax nexus. But the basic idea is you must have a prominent presence in a state. And so there's a couple ways for you to check and see if your company has tax nexus in a state. Kind of the simplest way is just to see if you have a state registration to do business in a given state. And the reason for that is, you will actually, when you start conducting business in a state, typically you have to register. And so that's kind of a nice little shortcut. \n\nAnd by the way, the state knows you registered with them. So they're more likely to check on you and make sure you're filing the right sales tax and tax returns, things like that. So that's the first really kind of shortcut way. The more established way is to evaluate whether you have employees, or assets or property in a state. That's basically like anyone who's really working in a state, you're gonna start triggering tax nexus. So for example, if you're a startup, and you have a W2 employee working in a state, and that W2 employee is renting office space, you are definitely gonna start triggering tax nexus in that state. That is, that's pretty clear cut. It's a little tougher to determine sometimes if there's just like a computer or some very small amount of assets in a state. But generally speaking, most of our clients are really kind of people businesses.  \n\nNow, in the modern day, there's a lot of, you know, business conducted over the internet in the form of ecommerce sales, or software sales or service sales. And so the states a few years ago, felt like they're missing out. And so they brought, there was a big Supreme Court case called Wayfair versus South Dakota, and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of South Dakota. And that gave states the ability to tax businesses, even if they didn't have a physical presence in the state. So all sudden, online sales, online software sales, online diagnostic or some forms of biotech stuff, all of a sudden became taxable, if they pass a certain threshold. A lot of times that threshold is right around $100,000. And not all states are collecting this type of sales tax. \n\nBut if you're doing business across the United States, and you have some states where you're getting close to that $100,000 threshold, it's getting very, very likely that you've actually created tax nexus, you'll have to file sales tax returns, and you'll probably have to file a state tax return. So I hope that helps. The big picture on tax nexus is that if you're doing business in a state\nphysically with employees, property, assets things like that you're pretty sure you've triggered tax nexus. And if you're doing business in the sense that you're selling a lot of goods or services over $100,000 usually. You've also probably triggered tax nexus. But we can do a study for you. We can help you out. We can parse this figure out if you really have triggered nexus and we can take care of all the forms you need to file. Thanks so much, bye.",

      "description": "In this video, you’ll learn if pro rata participation is a good strategy for angel and seed investors in future financing.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:21 Two major strategies\n01:38 Second strategy\n02:06 One of the key awesome terms\n04:06 Benefit of very low cost basis in your first bite\n04:25 Conclusion\n\n***********************************\nAdditional Resources\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBNe19SdRMA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnTG6xizHaI\n\n***********************************\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\n#prorata #prorataparticipation #seedinvestors\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today I'm answering the question, \"Should angel and seed investors buy all the shares they can, upfront, or should they save some of their capital for pro-rata participation in the future?\" \n\nThese are like the two major strategies in very early-stage investing, and I'll kind of go through them. So the first strategy is just like, \"Hey, don't overthink it.\" You've got a certain amount of money you invest in each startup. Maybe you're an angel investor that does 25K or 50K, or you're a seed fund that does a million bucks. Some people think you should buy as many shares, aka, put all your money in, to the company, as early as possible. That gives you the lowest possible cost basis and the most shares possible, kind of going forward. \n\nSo you look really, really smart in the big winners, because you just like backed up the truck and bought as much as possible at the earliest stage. You often see this in IPO prospectuses, where the VC firm will have an 11 cents cost basis, or 20-cent cost basis, and the company's IPOing at 50 bucks. These are huge winners, and you maximized your ownership at the earliest stage. Super-duper smart. This is actually the strategy I subscribe to. Like I do a little tiny bit of angel investing, and I actually believe in it this way, because just getting the benefit of those less expensive rounds, and doubling or tripling up on ownership, to me, is the right way to go. However, there is another strategy, which is, put a good chunk of money in early, you have conviction, you're gonna buy a bunch of shares, but save a percentage of your capital. \n\nSometimes they're called reserves. We have another video on VC reserves, which you can check out, but save some of your money, usually it's kind of like 30% of whatever you were gonna invest in total, for future participations. And one of the key awesome terms that venture capitalists get are future pro-rata, meaning they can protect their ownership position by participating in future rounds. This is a contractual benefit they get. Now, there are times where seed investors or angels don't get this. There's often times where they're promised this, but then the big funds kind of elbow them out, and the founders request they don't exercise pro-rata. \n\nBut generally speaking, pro-rata is an incredible option, because you only do your pro-ratas in the best companies. So if you think about the distribution of a angel or seed-stage portfolio, there's a lot of companies that don't make it, and a few big winners. And so being able to maximize the amount of capital and the number of participations you get in the winners is actually like crazy powerful optionality. So instead of, you know, for all those companies that you maximize your ownership in strategy one, that I subscribe to, you might be wasting like 30% of the capital that went into those companies, because you didn't save some for pro-rata, and some of those are gonna be losers, right? \n\nSo the idea on strategy two, which is saving some reserves and participating along the way, is, \"Heck, who cares if you're paying 5x or 10x more than your original cost basis in the huge winners\", because you are concentrating your capital in those huge winners, you have the benefit of information and knowledge and track record, and can see exactly what's happening at that future point. And so that money is an incredible investment. So again, there's really, in angel and seed-stage investing, there's no real definitive method. \n\nAgain, I like to get it all in at first, because sometimes you are at the risk where you actually don't get to do your pro-rata, even though you were promised it, or you're never promised it and you don't get to participate. And again, the benefit of that very, very low cost basis in your first bite of the apple can be very powerful, but hey, there's plenty of very successful angel and seed investors who do reserve 20, 30, 40% of their total capital committed for each company, and they play the pro-rata game, and they play it very effectively, and they have great returns, too.",

You are completely disregarding revenue, and I'll come back to that in a second. But gross burn rate is basically your operating expenses, any taxes, registrations and that kind of stuff. Some people also like to add in CapEx expenditures, which is a completely valid way of looking at it. But basically the amount of money going out the company's doors without factoring revenue in. And the reason to do this is it's the most conservative version of your burn rate. It's the highest, right? Because revenue would offset or reduce your burn rate. \n\nAnd it's important because it gives you the most conservative cash out date, AKA we're going to run out of cash sooner than if you factor in revenue. And the reason is in startups, revenue can really be volatile, can be up and down. You can have some traction, then traction can go away but you're still cranking as a company. So I personally like to look at it both ways. The first thing I do is look at regular burn rate that includes revenue and some generally hopefully conservative projections on revenue. But just to sanity check what I'm seeing there, I will then look at gross burn rate because I want to know the absolute worst case scenario. \n\nSo again, gross burn rate is the worst case scenario for your cash out date, and it's good to know. You don't want to kid yourself. You really want to have that honest look. I always start again with factoring revenue projections in that are conservative, but right before you're done looking at your cash out date and what your burn is, always take a look at the gross burn rate. It'll be a really helpful sanity check.

And the reason for that is we're recording this in late June, 2022, and the stock market has really corrected, like valuations have come way down. And yet there's a bunch of companies that frankly just need to raise money. And so it's really tough emotionally and kind of analytically to go to the venture capital market if you're a startup founder and just hear that like the valuation nowadays is half the size or two thirds the size of what you could have gotten six months ago. \n\nAnd when that valuation has been cut in half, so to speak, well, the dilution you're experiencing when you're selling stock in the company is really dramatic. It's a lot more than you would've experienced previously if you sold at a much higher valuation. And so there's this really painful kind of realization that the founders have to go through, and that's why I've been kind of telling them this phrase, like dilution never killed a company. Because really, they have a couple of options. They can cut expenses so deeply, but sometimes that's really kind of almost like self-inflicting, sometimes that just means you're not going to be able to hit your milestones and the company's actually going to be dead in the water anyways. \n\nSo oftentimes the right move is to raise a little bit more of capital. And oftentimes, the only way you can kind of get that done in a tough market is to open up the last round valuation. And that might be six months ago, that might be a year ago. And the founder looks at it and says like, \"I've made so much progress since I last raised money,\" but the investors are looking at it and saying like, \"The market has changed. You know, that old valuation is actually higher than what it would be today, but I'm a believer in the company and so I'll write that extra check.\" And again, it's a huge emotional hurdle, analytically it's tough, but oftentimes it's the right thing for the company to do. And the company can raise a little bit of extra money, not cut to the bone, management has a very clear head, you can hit your future milestones. \n\nAnd oftentimes, in my experience, these really deep market troughs like we're experiencing right now, they're very rapid. Often, there's a pretty good bounce. And if you raised that additional capital and you kept your momentum up, you are going to benefit on the other side, like when the valuations swing back to a really positive area, you will benefit. Furthermore, I always encourage the founders to just do the dilution calculation on their own ownership, because a lot of times it's a lot smaller than you might think. \n\nAnd oftentimes, like two co-founders running a company, maybe take and raise at least one round, maybe two rounds, they'll own something like 25 to 35%, something like that. And say they do like a cheap and dilutive, you know, slash painful round, like I'm advocating for, taking just a little bit extra money. And maybe they sell 10% of the company for that, you know, again, just to keep the lights on, keep the momentum up and running. Well, if you own 30% in a company and you take 10% dilution, we really only lost three percentage points. \n\nNow you're down to 27%. And when you kind of do the math that way, it's easier to see that this isn't like a haircut in ownership that's going to like change your life or destroy your future financial upside. Really, what you're doing is giving the company the oxygen, the cash that it needs so that you have a much better chance of getting to an exit and actually getting a better realization on that remaining ownership you have.",

That used to be like a million and a half, two, but inflation and the frothier venture capital climate, are yielding bigger rounds. Even with the NASDAQ correcting, we're still seeing companies raise very, very healthy seed stage rounds. And by the way, the music has not stopped in that market, still lots of seed activity. Which is really good for entrepreneurs. \n\nOne thing I always like to tell folks that asked me like, what's happening in the venture capital market. Guess what, startup founders never stop creating companies, they will, there will be the worst depression in the history of the United States, someday, and startup founders will still be creating new ventures and going and trying to change the world. So, the fundraising climate, of course, matters because it depends on, or factors into how much cash they're going to have to build their dream. But these people are committed, they're super smart, I feel very fortunate to get to work with them every single day at Kruze, and they will just keep going. So, in light of the new environment, though, and maybe you know, the $3 million seed is kind of back, that's probably more standard nowadays than like maybe the five or 4 million. How do you manage your cash, because guess what? Interest rates have been going up, that's part of the reason why the rounds are, you know, getting a little smaller, because people are getting more conservative in the startup market, or the tech market has corrected a little bit. Well, yields are climbing up, especially in money market funds, in short-term bond markets. \n\nAnd so, my advice to startup founders in the seed stage is still take advantage of smart cash management procedures. But safety is like of the most important thing possible for you, because most seed stage companies will raise like 18 months of cash, not 12, that's usually not enough time, sometimes they'll get it out to 24 months, which is great. But 18 months is usually what a seed stage round will get you and you have that amount of time to build, you know, a prototype or build a working product, get some customers and convince either a seed extension round or a Series A firm to come in and fund you going forward. So, you really can't afford to lose any of this money. Like you can't afford to buy like a 12-month bond and have interest rates keep going up and having to sell that at a discount and taking a haircut on your cash. \n\nSo, keep the money very liquid, very safe. If you're going to, I personally recommend like, putting it into a money market fund with daily liquidity. That means you can pull the money out on a daily basis. So, whenever you need it, you pull it out, if there's an emergency, if the markets melting down, you can pull it out. The other option is buying bond ladders of very short maturity, like three months, maybe six months. But again, interest rates are going up. If interest rates go up, and you own a bunch of bonds and you need to sell those bonds, you're going to have to sell them at a discount, because whoever's buying them is going to want like, kind of the market rate of return, the market interest rate. \n\nSo, be very, very careful with that. You can also keep the money in, you know, a portion of the money in a certificate of deposit at a bank, you again want to keep the maturity on that pretty light, probably like three months, the max you want to do there.",

On a whim, I tried an accounting class, and it just instantly clicked.\n\nI'm Vanessa Kruze. I'm the founder of Kruze Consulting. I do accounting, finance, tax, and HR specifically for startups.\n\nWhen I first started, I found that there were really kind of a select few clients that I could really provide more than just bookkeeping or reports or taxes for. And those were the startups.\n\nSo I think for me being a trust advisor means openly sharing knowledge and information, and that really just builds the relationship from there.\n\nI would say that a big part of our success really comes from our team. We've gone from six or eight employees at the start of 2017, now up to 30, which is nuts.\n\nYou know, as we hired each and every person, we took our time and made sure that it was the right hire. And that was really the best way to go, because those foundational first people have really kind of carried the ball in terms of making sure that the clients still stay happy and making sure that they're training each other.\n\nI really discovered more of the human aspect of accounting. It wasn't just about the reports anymore; it was about helping our founders grow their business. So in many ways, I get to be kind of like the co-pilot to all of these amazing startups that are doing amazing things, and if I can help those companies be successful, that's what makes me really happy at the end of the day.",

      "title": "What is the Backsolve Method for 409A Valuation?",
      "description": "What is the Backsolve Method for 409A Valuation?\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about the Back-Solve Method for 409A valuations. \n\nAnd for those that don't know, there's a couple of different ways you get to a 409A evaluation, which is a, basically what a company uses to price its stock options, like the price per share of its common stock options. And so you've got the Back-Solve Method. You've got the cost to recreate. You've got a cashflow analysis. You have comparable company in M&A comps. Those are like kind of the big ways, but the Back-Solve Method is actually one of the most popular. And partially because it's, it's actually fairly simple. And it's actually one of the things that have allowed 409A valuations to come down in price. Like 15 years ago, 409A evaluations costs, you know, like 20 grand something crazy. \n\nNowadays it's, you know, $2,000 to $5,000 basically, is the price. So the Back-Solve Method basically looks at the last round a startup has completed, assuming it's fairly recent, kind of 12 to 18 months is really like that zone that you want to be looking at. If it's an older valuation than that, the Back-Solve Method may not be appropriate because the valuation isn't that fresh. And essentially the Back-Solve Method assumes that very smart professional investors have priced that last round at a respectable price with the market clearing prices, and therefore, valuation professionals can rely on that price. However, the previous valuation is typically a preferred stock valuation because you know, like investors, VCs, they want liquidation preferences and redemption rights and other kinds of, of terms that go in preferred. \n\nWhile, you know, again, the common stock doesn't have that kind of stuff. And so people actually apply a discount against the preferred to get the common stock. So the Back-Solve Method would take the previous valuation, and then it's typically going to be the sum of a couple of different discounts, like marketability and some other things. You're typically going to get something like 25 to 35% of the preferred price is going to be common. So let's just take $10 a share for the preferred price. And we're going to apply our discounts. We're going to back-solve to the common price and it's going to end up being, you know, something like $2.50 to $3.50 per share. So again, you're relying on the professional investors, who've priced the previous round, but because that previous round is typically in preferred stock, you're going to apply a couple different discounts. \n\nAnd you're usually going to get to about kind of the ratio of 25 to 35% common to preferred. So I hope that helps. I know it's a little complicated, but really when you see it applied a couple of times and you read a few 409A evaluations, it's pretty clear. And again, that is one of the things that has made 409A valuations, so much cheaper, so much affordable, and really every company should get one when they're issuing stock options. I hope that helps.",

And today I'm answering the question: How often does my startup have to get a 409A Valuation? \n\nAnd it's a pretty quick answer. It's either every 12 months or when you have a material change in valuation. So like you do another round, valuation's up, valuation's down, whatever it is. If it's a material amount of money, then you do need to get a new 409A valuation because the new valuation is going to impact the valuation of the common stock that you're getting the 409A valuation price for. \n\nSo just remember, every 12 months, it's almost like going to the dentist, but you do that every 12 months. Or you're lucky enough to raise around within the 12 month time period. \n\nAnd you just need to get a new valuation. Very cheap, very easy to do.

Research key terms and negotiating strategies at https://kruzeconsulting.com/venture-debt/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today, I'm answering the question, how do you account for seed investment in your startup? Now, there are four main ways. Convertible debt, safe notes, preferred equity, and common stock. So, let's go through them in order. \n\nConvertible debt is debt just like it says. It typically converts into equity at a set valuation down the road. But when the money comes into the company, you wanna book that as debt and only convert it once actually documentation is signed for the conversion. Next, is safe notes. \n\nNow, safe notes are equity. Now, sometimes lawyers will disagree on this, but we're very confident it's equity. That goes in the equity section of your balance sheet. Eventually, that too will convert into preferred stock, but for the time being, when the money comes in, book it as its own line item on the balance sheet in the equity section. \n\nNext, is preferred equity. This is typically what big VCs like institutions like to invest in, because as a liquidation preference and other perks, that will be preferred equity and that will be on the equity component of your balance sheet. And you want to make sure that's its own line item as well. And typically, what we like to do is book series A, series B, series C, as their own line items so it's really easy to keep track and make sure you don't get confused. It makes reconciling against the CAP table so much easier. \n\nFinally is common stock. Now common stock is equity. It's typically what the founders own. It's very rare for an investor to come in in common stock, but it does happen once in a while, so I wanted you to be aware of it. But most of the time, that's gonna reflect the founders and management team ownership in the company. Not real professional investment. Now, I hope this helps. \n\nThe four ways that you can book your equity or seed investment into your company. So, we've got convertible debt, safe notes, equity, preferred equity, and common equity. Hope that helps. Thanks, bye.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nDoes your VC backed startup need help to manage your books, burn, and projections? Kruze’s clients have raised over $3.5 billion in venture funding - find out how we help companies fly through diligence and raise the next round: https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-venture-capital-finance-experts/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nWe're here to talk about deferred revenue and why it's important to a lot of different startups. What is deferred revenue? Deferred revenue, otherwise known as unearned revenue, is really important to startups that receive payments or prepayments upfront for their service. Deferred revenue is technically a liability that will show up on your balance sheet. \n\nA side note, since balance sheets balance, the asset that goes on the balance sheet to make the balance sheet balance would generally be cash. And obviously, startups appreciate cash. Now I'm going to ignore the fact that there could be receivables which might complicate the balance sheet a little bit and just stick with talking about deferred revenue. \n\nSo, why is deferred revenue a liability? Deferred revenue is a liability because you've gotten cash or payment, and in exchange, you owe your client a future service you have not yet delivered the service that they've paid you for. So it's a liability because you owe that to them. Let's do a pretty simple deferred revenue example. Let's say you're a software as a service startup.  A SAAS startup Your service is one hundred dollars a month and a client prepays for the full year. \n\nSo, they give the startup twelve hundred dollars. In that very first month startup is able to recognize 100 dollars’ worth of revenue so they deliver one hundred dollars’ worth of their service to that client. Now the deferred revenue balance was that full cash amount that they received the twelve hundred dollars. And then minus the one hundred dollars, that's recognized. So, at the end of that first month, there is an eleven hundred dollar deferred revenue balance for this client. The next month the startup delivers another one hundred dollars’ worth of service, recognizes another one hundred dollars’ worth of revenue and the deferred revenue balance again goes down one hundred dollars from eleven hundred dollars to one thousand dollars. And this will continue over the life of the contract until the last month when the last one hundred dollars is recognized and this startup has a zero-dollar balance in their deferred revenue account. \n\nSo, the cash impacts of this can be confusing. Let's assume that you only sell that single contract. So, your revenue looks like over the course of the 12 months that you have one hundred dollars in revenue every month but you only got your cash up front. You got the twelve hundred dollars up front and you did not receive any other cash during the lifetime of that customer relationship. \n\nSo, if your startup has expenses like most do you'll see your cash balance going down. Your bank account will be decreasing even though you're recognizing the same amount of revenue every month. And that's because all the cash came in upfront and then you're delivering the service over time. \n\nSo that's a very high-level explanation of deferred revenue. And I hope that's helpful.",

      "title": "How Good Bookkeeping Pays for Itself",
      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question, how can good bookkeeping pay for itself? \n\nNow, a lot of people try to save money by hiring a bad bookkeeper or the Craigslist Special, or maybe someone who claims to be automated but they really just have a giant team in the Philippines or something like that. So those are examples of bad bookkeeping, and believe me, that is super costly. But a lot of people know that good bookkeeping can actually pay for itself. So here's a couple reasons. \n\nThe first way is you actually know what you're spending money on. You could actually look at your financials, they're accurate, and you can quickly cut your burn, especially in times like COVID because you know where the pockets of extra spend are just through having accurate financials. So that's one way. The second way is you fly through VC or M&A due diligence. I can't tell you how many times and how pleased that makes me when a founder calls me and says, \"Hey, I just got a term sheet.\" Or, \"Hey, I just got a verbal offer \"from an M&A company that's gonna buy us.\" And they say, \"What do we need to do? \"We probably need to scramble \"and fix a bunch of stuff in our financials.\" And I get to say, \"Actually, they're done. \"They're perfect, we're good. \"Send 'em the financials.\" \n\nSo that signal and ability to move fast, really makes VC and M&A due diligence so much faster. Your financials do not become an issue. They do not slow down a deal. They do not make the investors think that you might be disorganized or don't have a good feel for your business and therefore give you a lower valuation. \n\nSo that's another way that bookkeeping can really pay for itself. And then the other thing that people don't always think about, but this happens a lot with some of the automated accountants, is that we constantly are coming in and finding missed invoices or missed payments. So a very simple example is, maybe someone at the automated place, but probably has a big staff in the Philippines or somewhere else, just marked the invoice paid that was never paid, and is never caught. And we've found so many 20, 25, $30,000 invoices that were never collected or the invoice was deleted by a poor accountant, and so the management team didn't know about it. So that happens all the time. \n\nThe other thing that happens is that vendors are double paid. But because it's poor accounting, you actually don't know you double paid the vendor because the accountant couldn't figure it out. And so those are two examples where it's pretty big dollar amounts that are either missing or going out twice that a good accountant would catch, and it'd really pay for like their whole annual fee, just one time. And then the fourth reason why I think good bookkeeping pays for itself, is when we have good bookkeeping, it's very easy to do an R&D tax credit, and you can get your rebate on your payroll taxes very quickly. \n\nNow a lot of startups don't know about this, but you actually have to submit highly detailed audits or an actual plan of what R&D happened, who was doing it, you know, time logs, estimates, all that stuff, but it all starts with good bookkeeping with the salary breakouts and knowing what other tools were used for that R&D.\n\nSo a good bookkeeper makes your R&D credit a heck of a lot easier, which can be really big dollars. Last year we saved our clients $4 1/2 million, an average about $40,000 per R&D credit. \n\nSo having a good bookkeeper, it's good financial hygiene, it makes your life easier, it's way less stressful. It makes your VC diligence so much easier, but it also pays for itself. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com/ \n\nThe first one is you're always gonna take common stock, everyone on the management team is gonna take common stock. You don't wanna have one of the founders having preferred and a liquidation preference over everyone. That's just weird, that's not gonna happen. \n\nThe second thing is you really wanna have a vesting period on everyone's shares and what this does is it protects the founders that end up staying with the company for many years from some of the other founders who might leave after a year or two. By having a vesting period, typically it's a four-year or a five-year vesting period, where you vest, if it's a five-year vesting period you vest 20% of your stock every year and usually there's a one-year cliff, so you vest 20% after the first year and then you do the rest of it on a monthly basis. \n\nNow there's another thing that gets discussed, it's kind of a tough topic, but sometimes you do not wanna have equal ownership between the founders. Now this is the case when one of the founders is gonna make a more significant contribution than the others. A typical founding pair might be one kind of business or sales or strategy person and a technical founder. That's kind of the combo we see quite a bit at Kruze Consulting, but maybe the technical person was recruited late to the idea and they weren't the person that really took the germ of the idea and really built it out. \n\nI have one other pro tip for all the founders out there. This isn't about the ownership split but please, for the love of God, file your 83b filing with the IRS within 30 days of founding the company and buying your founder shares, it is so important. Make sure that it is certified mail, keep that receipt for the rest of your life. You do not wanna screw up the 83b. This happens occasionally, it is really hard to reverse. The 83b basically gives you a really low cost basis and you can get capital gains on all your appreciation after that. \n\nSo have the tough conversation with the ownership split, have the tough conversation around the vesting period, and then after you have that conversation shake hands, hug, and then fill out that 83b form and walk over to the post office and mail it together. You will be covered, you will not have to worry about that kind of stuff. I hope that helps, thanks.",

And the basic idea is they're giving you stock options to try to help retain you. They recognize that you're working in the company, you're putting your blood, sweat, and hopefully no tears, but maybe some tears, into the company. \n\nAnd so you get a little bit of equity in the company. But instead of giving that equity to you all at once and saying, \"Thank you very much,\" if they did that, you might just leave and have all the stock. And so what they do is they vest it over, typically, four years. So the first 12 months are typically called a cliff, meaning you don't vest anything until you complete those full 12 months. \n\nThen after that, you start vesting on a monthly basis. All the way up till typically that 48 month period, you know, four years times 12 months in a year. But again, you're just gonna get a little sliver of stock every month, essentially, and the employer, the startup is hoping that helps keep you at the startup because you start seeing a lot of upside. And sometimes you even get like a second or third equity grant that will have its own vesting schedule for those equity grants. So I hope that helps. \n\nThe kind of moral of the story is you're not gonna get all the stock right up front. It's gonna come over time, which frankly helps align you and the startup because the startup wants you there and it needs you to create value over time. But hopefully that value is pretty huge and the stock price goes up and you can make some money on that. Hope that helps, thanks.",

Having a solid budget helps your startup hit its goals without prematurely running out of cash. A number of us here at Kruze Consulting have worked in fast-growing startups and we've compiled our tips on how to make this budgeting process work. The most important thing is you need to understand or have a vision of what your long-term strategy is and what you need to do to achieve those goals. You'll want to bake your budget around what your strategy is, and the budget is actually the financial representation of that strategy. You got to make sure your team knows what the strategy is - what your financial goals are in terms of the revenue that you need to hit and the cash need to burn. Or what features need to be built and then you'll want to start to pay careful attention to the key parts of the budget. So, for most early-stage startups, the biggest part of burn is headcount. So, you want to pay careful attention to your headcount projections over the coming year and because you'll put this together with your team and your team will have their headcount projections. It will really help them manage their team in a particular know when they need to start recruiting so they'll know when they\n\nshould be able to bring on additional heads. You should have a very strong opinion on what the revenue should be over the next year. So for example, if you're a SAAS company you should know what your next milestone needs to be in terms of recurring revenue so that you can successfully raise your next round. And then you'll want to build your plan and your budget around what it takes to get there. You want to be very careful around your burn rate. So you want to know how much money you're burning so that you don't prematurely run out of money. And then you'll want to know what your monthly burn is at the end of the year like the burn of the exit with at the end of the year so that you can project your cash out date. \n\nYou want to make sure you're not...  You want to make sure that you run out of cash when you expect to run out of cash which hopefully aligns with you being worth more and raising more capital. Once you've got all this put together you can make sure that it's carefully shared with your department leaders so they can come back and build their detailed budgeting plans with you.  And also, they can very clearly understand what their goals are. I hope this helps you with your startup's budgeting.",

That means making sure the books are closed and closed correctly every month. \n\nTypically, that's Quick Books management. So, when a startup CFO at Kruze is working with a client, of course, they are managing the internal Kruze team. The staff accountants, the controllers, making sure that the financials are delivered quickly, making sure delivered accurately, and also making sure all the questions get answered. \n\nA lot of times there's questions for the CEO. How do you spend money on this? What vendors that? What time period does this cover? Those are all questions that a good startup CFO can solve or answer very, very quickly. \n\nThe second thing is the financial projections. Managing the actual financial model, building the financial model, in most cases. Also doing the budget actuals. It's great to have a financial model with the beauty of that is you can actually track see how you're doing. That way you can give reports to the board, to the CEOs, so the CEO knows how they're tracking against all of the other metrics. \n\nAlso, helping manage a financial or capital raise. So, a lot of times we're doing this in the context of venture debt for our clients, but also our clients are always raising Series A, Series B, Series C. So, managing that process, making sure the PowerPoint's updated, making sure the most recent financial model is ready to go. Those are all super important things and also just getting back to investors diligence requests. Investors and lenders ask for tons of information and so having a CFO who can actually get that back to the investor is very, very helpful. And \n\nfinally, there's a bunch of legal things that happen in startups: there's insurance, there are leases, there are loan documents; there's tons of stuff that the CFO can actually manage for the CEO. And again, when you're hiring a startup CFO, which are really trying to do as a CEO of a startup, is extend your time and make sure you have someone who's really strong, solving problems that you could probably solve, but don't really want to because you want to build product and get more customers and build your company. \n\nAnd so, the things that a good startup CFO does is own financial reporting, own financial model projections, and also own legal and all the documentation that goes along with it. Hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nIf you’re a startup issuing equity compensation (Options/NQSO/ISO), you’ll need a 409A for startup purposes. Get started now at https://kruzeconsulting.com/409a_valuation/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting, and today we're talking about why these startups need a 409A valuation. Well, the quick part of that is the IRS requires it. The IRS wants you to have a 409A valuation so they can make sure that your common stock options have the appropriate strike price. Now, back in the day, in the good, old days, the board of directors used to just make up a number for the strike price for options, and oftentimes that was usually one penny because it's the simplest thing to do, but the IRS realized that that usually wasn't representative of the real value or price per share of those options, and so they started mandating 409A valuations. Now, the good news is, we do 409A valuations. We have a great page on our website that explains how much that costs starting at $1,500, all the documentation you need to actually do one, and we can do it in 10 days, so that's fantastic, but you just know that what you're really doing is buying audit protection. You're making sure that you have an independent, third-party value your company, value the common stock, and document that, document why the value is actually what it is. Typically, there are ways of doing it like the back-solve method or cost to recreate. Sometimes people use a discounted cash flow or comparable company costs. Those are the ways people do evaluations to get to this price per share that the common stock should be issued at. Again, what you're really doing is making sure the IRS is happy and that if you ever get audited you're protected because you used a valid third-party. Hope that helps on 409A valuations. Thanks.",

      "title": "Do Venture Capitalists Use a 409A Valuation to Value a Startup?",
      "description": "Do Venture Capitalists Use a 409A Valuation to Value a Startup?\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today I'm answering the question, do venture capitalists use a 409A valuation to value a startup? \n\nAnd this is a very common question from founders, and basically, let's define a 409A first. The IRS requires startups to do a 409A valuation process from an accredited valuation provider to price the common stock price, which is used as the exercise price for employee stock options. So you gotta keep the IRS happy. They don't want you issuing stock options at too low of a valuation, and so you do a 409A. \n\nBut, everyone around the table at the company typically wants the 409A price to be pretty low. The reason for that is it helps with employee retention. If the employees have a lower valuation, they have more incentive with the stock price rising, and it's also cheaper for them to exercise those options. We've all heard of those horrible stories of employees not having enough money when they leave a company to exercise, and so they have to just forfeit those options. \n\nSo, pretty much everyone, the board, the management team, and the employees want that stock option price to be low, within reason and within fairness. Now, the problem that founders feel is they're worried that the venture capitalist will take that low valuation and then effectively low ball them on the price of their next round. They're saying, \"Hey, this is documentation. This is what the company is worth. Why don't we pay this low price instead of the normal high price?\" And it's a totally understandable concern. \n\nHowever, you do not have to worry about that. Investors will almost never even talk about the 409A price except to approve it in a board meeting. They know that they are buying preferred stock, and not common stock. And preferred has liquidation preferences, it has redemption provisions, it has share class vote, which gives them a really strong ability to control the company. There's dividends, there's just a lot of things in preferred stock that are much better terms than common stock. And so, they know that they are always gonna pay up and pay a higher valuation for the preferred stock. And that's really what the round gets priced on. \n\nNow, if you do have a venture capitalist who's using a 409A price, you need to get a new venture capitalist, so don't sign that term sheet. Go find someone else. But again, VCs are very savvy. They know that the 409A is not to be used against a founder, and that the company effectively wants those prices to be low. So, don't worry about it. Get the 409A valuation. Send your conservative financials in to your valuation provider. Make sure you pick the comparable companies that are good matches, but also conservative. And you may even do a cost to recreate for the valuation provider. That will set you up, you'll get your accurate price. \n\nAnd you're not gonna have to worry about your VC negotiating against you using that 409A price. Hope that helps, thanks.",

They help them with financial modeling, budget to actuals, they help with board prep. They can do a lot of operational things, like insurance, leases. There's a million things a startup CFO can do. Obviously they're going to review the financials every month and make sure everything's accurate, tighten that stuff up, get feedback or info from the management team. \n\nAnd so it's a really great tool. We typically see startup CFOs. The average startup CFO typically has three or four clients and they charge one of two ways. The first one is they just bill an hourly rate, like $250 an hour to $350 an hour. And that's pretty standard. It ranges, obviously, it's always negotiable, of course. But startup CFOs are in pretty high demand right now so the kind of negotiation leverage is on their side. I tend to see that in the market. But also some of them will just do a fixed monthly fee and allocate one full day per week to you. \n\nSo like, every Tuesday they're going to work with your company, and they carry those three or four clients, so they have, theoretically, Friday is a flux day that they can spend more time with a certain client or really get in the weeds with and provide more advisory. But it's usually that monthly fixed fee, or they bill on an hourly rate. You do have to worry, or one thing to kind of validate is make sure the CFO is not getting overextended. I have a lot of friends who, unfortunately, sometimes they end up having to take more clients than they want, whether it's a mandate from the firm they're working for or what, and they kind of complain to me privately that they end up only being able to spend like two hours or one hour a month on a given client, especially the small clients. \n\nAnd at that point, they're not really adding value and they actually feel bad they're not adding value. The whole reason they got into this business was to be helpful and help startups grow. And so it becomes a sub-optimal relationship for them. So you want to really make sure they're not taking on too many clients, and the good ones will tell you. The good ones will also say, \"You know what, I'm too busy right now,\" and, \"Let me check in with you in six months.\" I hear that constantly, especially in the market we're in right now. So I hope that helps on kind of the ways they charge and what to look for. The one other little way of approaching this problem is, you break up the kind of services you need in the sense that, say you just need a model and budget to actuals, well, you could work with someone like Kruze who does our, we have CFOs but we also have just an FP&A group that does the financial model and monthly budget to actuals. \n\nAnd I find sometimes when clients or prospects actually talk to me and they say like, \"I need a CFO,\" what they're actually really asking for is that month, is the financial model to share with their investors or raise capital off of, and then that monthly budget to actual cadence. It's actually very popular and it's a great way to manage your company. Seeing where you're kind of overextended or spent too much money in a given category or under-invested in a given category on a monthly basis, is very, very valuable. And so I really recommend that service. \n\nSo hopefully this helps. CFOs, very, very helpful, great resource. I think every startup should consider this, or at the very least the monthly budget to actuals. And if you have any other questions hit us up at kruzeconsulting.com.

Only startups that have generated revenue for five years or less can claim the new tax credit. That means that if you had receipts prior to 2012 then you're ineligible. \n\nAnd second, your startup must have made less than 5 million in revenue in 2018. and each subsequent year that you actually claim the payroll offset in the future. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to reach out to me.

Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting and today we're talking about three tips for Gusto users after you've signed up. So now you've made your big payroll decision. You're working with Gusto. And the first little thing that comes up sometimes is that people don't know Gusto has two-day payroll and four-day payroll. Meaning they take the money out of your account four days before payroll or two days. Now, we all like having more money in our account. We can make an interest that way. So most people like two-day payroll. But to get to two-day payroll, you have to go through Gusto's assurance teams because they need to make sure you have enough money in your account for them to take that little bit of risk that you are worth it and they can float you the money for those two days. So the big kind of mess up sometimes comes when people don't realize your two-day payroll has a dollar limit. So sometimes when companies grow really fast, they start exceeding that dollar limit of payroll. Sometimes it's fifty thousand, sometimes seventy-five thousand. So you need to remember if you are on two-day payroll to keep pushing your maximum payroll amount up with Gusto. That means you need to check-in probably once a quarter given your size, your company, and your hiring needs, and just make sure you're still eligible for two-day payroll. And to see if you need to push up your limit just a little bit more. A second thing that people sometimes make a little mess up on is they don't know that when they hire a new employee in a different state, Gusto wants you to sign up to do business in that state. And also sign up for payroll taxes in that state. Things like unemployment tax, that kind of stuff. Well, when you hire that new employee in another state, it puts an immediate block on your payroll. People don't know that. Founders don't know that. So usually we're giving them the heads up. We'll register you in those other states and register for payroll taxes but just know your payroll on autopilot is blocked. Now a really easy way to solve this... Just let us know at Kruze and we'll send Gusto a quick little note asking for an extension on the block. Usually, they give us like a 30-day block extension. That way you can run payroll normally for two weeks or four weeks and while you're processing that registration in the state it's really easy, but it's something that sometimes people just forget about. And the third thing to remember is when you have a big accounting partner like Kruze Consulting that does a ton of business with Gusto, we actually get premium support. So Gusto answers our emails and phone calls before they answer the founder's emails and phone calls. This is not something they advertise, but they're used to doing business with us. They know that we're super knowledgeable. We know that we're very efficient and we're not going to waste our time. So they prioritize us. So if you're working with someone like Kruze, ask them to send Gusto a support message. They'll get the question answered a lot faster. Instead of sitting there for a couple of days waiting for Gusto to get back to you because you're lower in the queue. The Kruze Consulting team will get answered probably within the day. So those are three little tips for Gusto users for startups after you sign up for Gusto. So now you're using the product. I hope that helps. Thanks.",

      "description": "Trinet Review for Startups\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping, finance, or taxes? Visit Kruze to see if our team can help you! https://kruzeconsulting.com\n\nTriNet basically works as your payroll, your HR solution, they do some tax compliance and they also handle all your benefits and they also handle R&D tax credits for you. So it's an all-in-one big bundled solution. And it's pretty effective. And there's a little wrinkle in TriNet and other PEOs in that when they work with a client, like a startup, the startup's employees actually have a direct employment relationship with TriNet and kinda like a secondary employment relationship with the startup. \n\nAnd because of this, that's where the professional employer organization title comes in, because of that, TriNet is able to pool all of its different clients' employees and because they can do that, they can actually negotiate better terms with all the medical insurance companies. And so you can imagine, a small startup with 20 employees is not gonna get the same type of rates, I'm making a gross generalization here, but as someone like TriNet who has probably hundreds of thousands of employees under their umbrella. So it's really attractive in that aspect. \n\nThe other attractive aspect is that TriNet will do all your payroll and they're also gonna handle your HR. And so when you have an issue, TriNet is very, very responsive on the HR front because guess what? They're sharing some of the liability with you. So they wanna make sure that things get done correctly, they get done quickly and both the employee and the employer is protected. So that's a really nice feature. \n\nNow, one of the other things that TriNet will handle for you is your state tax compliance. They don't every state, they don't handle everything but in a lot of states, they will help register you in that state and help register you for payroll taxes. Now, this is really nice, especially in the COVID era that we're in right now because we're seeing a lot of employees moving throughout the country and it's happening at Kruze, it's happening at our clients and so having a PEO solution who will actually handle that for you and again, share some of the liabilities so they're motivated to do it correctly is actually really nice. It's a nice value-add, simplifies the founder's life. \n\nNow, the alternative is our clients usually just have us do it and we're happy to do it. It's very inexpensive but hey, that's not our favorite thing to do either. So if TriNet's gonna do it, that's great. Now, there is one little negative with TriNet in that they do charge a pretty healthy subscription fee. So when you compare them against other payroll and benefits providers, those other providers typically are not as full service as TriNet. So they're significantly cheaper. \n\nTriNet is again, you're kinda like paying for, I think I'll date myself here, but the Cadillac Package. You're paying for the premium bundle and again, you can see how it's saving you a lot of time and money but they're gonna charge for that. So just know that TriNet's gonna be a little bit more expensive than a traditional payroll and HR firm. There's one other small downside and it's pretty much been handled now but TriNet, because they pool all of their clients, they have some pretty complicated IRS tax forms they have to file with the government and in terms of R&D tax credits, the R&D tax credits kind of get pooled as well. \n\nSo in the early days, three years ago, when R&D tax credits were first emerging, this was a little bit of an issue but TriNet did get certified by the IRS and they are good to go now. We're not having any issues with them on our new tax credits. In fact, they've very responsive and easy to work with on that. So that's something that they've actually improved over the last few years, which is really, really nice. \n\nSo I think there's a lot of positives with TriNet, again, they're gonna handle all your payroll, they're gonna handle your benefits, they're gonna handle those hot HR issues that no one really wants to deal with. They're gonna handle your state tax compliance, which is really nice. Again, they're not gonna do it all but they're gonna do a lot of it so it's gonna save you time. \n\nAnd you just have to realize you're gonna pay a little bit more than what a traditional payroll and benefits provider asks for because they are giving you a really premium service. So check out TriNet. We really recommend it. We like working with them a lot. Super nice people. And I think the final thing is they've invested a lot in their customer support in the last couple of years. \n\nIn the past, it was okay but now it's gotten a lot better and so we're very happy to recommend TriNet to our clients. Thanks.",

Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today, we're talking about PEOs, professional employer organizations. \n\nAnd so what PEOs do is they basically handle your startup's HR services. So payroll, benefits, HR policy, HR counseling. They also do a lot of tax stuff, like they help with state and local taxes in some instances. Not always, you kinda have to check it out state by state. And they usually don't do much on the municipality front. But PEOs are actually a really interesting approach to solving your HR problems. \n\nNow the interesting about PEOs is that instead of your employees working for the startup directly, the PEO is actually the employer of record, which means like the employees of the company actually sign a contract with the PEO, and they have kind of like a third relationship, kinda off to the side a little bit with the startup. So it sounds a little weird. But what it does is allows the PEO to pool all of their employees across all their clients, and actually negotiate better benefit rates. \n\nSo typically PEOs, they're kind of like negotiating like they're a Fortune 500 company you know. They have a lot of power when they're talking to BlueCross, or Anthem, or Kaiser, those kinda folks. And so that's actually one of the big benefits of PEOs is that you can often get lower benefit costs if you work through a PEO. The other benefit of a PEO is they will handle some of that state and local tax compliance, which is really nice. And because your employees are basically employees of the PEO, they have a super vested interest in making sure your HR policies are correct, HR problems are handled correctly so there's no liability. So those are the positives. \n\nSometimes on the negative side, PEOs tend to be a lot more expensive. They actually charge like a monthly fee per employee. That's much, much higher than Gusto or Rippling. So you're getting a benefit on one side with lower benefits cost and some of the extra services. But you're also paying more. That's kinda why I call it like, it's kinda like a Cadillac policy. It's taking the luxury approach. \n\nHowever in times of COVID, this can actually be really smart because as employees are spreading out throughout the country, I know this is happening at Kruze, you're starting to have to worry about more local and state tax, like payroll taxes and registrations. \n\nSo the PEO can really help you out there. And you have to worry about benefits in all these other states if the employees are gonna be there permanently. So COVID is actually driving a lot more interest in PEOs, which I find pretty interesting. Now a couple other downsides of PEOs. We've kinda noticed that the PEOs are not as effective or as fast at filing R&D tax credits and getting those rebate checks. And there's this thing called a certified, like the IRS basically certifies the PEO to be able to handle this stuff. So if your PEO that you're working with has not been certified, then that's not good. Your R&D tax credit's gonna have some real problems we've had this experience with kinda some lesser PEOs. Our favorites are Sequoia, TriNet, and Justworks. Those are kinda the \"big three\" in our world and the Kruze world. \n\nSo if you're working with someone else, odds are they're probably not doing the R&D tax credit correctly or quickly enough, and you might have some problems. And it's a little tricky for the PEOs because again, that benefit they get from pooling employees on the insurance benefit side, that actually kinda works against them on the R&D tax credit side, because a lot of  times, they're having to pool all these R&D tax credit filings underneath their own EIN number, which makes that super complicated and if there's a hangup somewhere, then a lot of companies' R&D tax credits are hung up. So you just need to investigate that.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping/ \n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today we're talking about what are the advantages of using a global PEO to pay for employees? \n\nNow, almost every company we work with has some type of team member, or many team members, distributed globally. It's just like how the world's going these days. So you need to be able to pay those team members. Now, what a global PEO is, is basically they're groups or companies that have set up foreign entities across the globe. So, they've done all the paperwork, all the hard compliance work, set up payroll relationships, and can run payroll and pay your employees in a bunch of different companies. So it really simplifies your life. If you're gonna have employees throughout the world. \n\nAnd the importance of actually running payroll and making sure those employees are paid is important because, A., hey, everyone likes to be an employee. You get some perks that you probably wouldn't get as a contractor, but more importantly, you're in compliance in those countries. You are giving those countries their payroll taxes and every government across the world loves payroll taxes. So you don't wanna be avoiding payroll taxes. You wanna make sure you're in compliance, especially as you start building a really big presence in that country. \n\nAnd so typically, there's two options. You can either do the global PEO or you can start a whole legal entity called a subsidiary and operate that subsidiary in the foreign country. But of course, doing that subsidiary actually creates a lot of legal costs, a lot of compliance headaches. And frankly, it's just distracting. It's not something like a startup should really be doing until they have like a 10 or 20 person presence in a country. And so that's where the global PEO comes in. You don't have to worry about getting that subsidiary going. You don't have to worry about filing tax returns for that subsidiary. It just works. \n\nNow, you do pay a premium and it's expensive. It's not cheap, but they're just saving you so much money. So that's typically what we do. We recommend that a company, when they start hiring in another country, start with a global PEO, and then once they've built a big presence, usually we kinda say 10 people is where the break even point is. \n\nThen you should look at starting a subsidiary, but global PEOs can be very cost-effective and most important, they're easy. And when you're running a startup, focus is super important. You need to build your product, you need to get customers. You don't wanna be dealing with foreign payroll and foreign subsidiaries. Now, I hope that helps. Thanks so much!",

I like to think of the COO or VP of Ops as like, if you're in a rock band, the Founder or CEO is typically like the lead singer, and you, COO, I'm a COO, so I can say this, you are like the bassist, or you're the drummer. You're very necessary for the company to make beautiful music, but you're kinda not the person that's out front and center for the company, that's typically the Founder or CEO. But that's okay, if your personality is suited to that and you enjoy the work, it's an incredible job. I enjoy my job thoroughly. So let's go through some of the functional things that a COO does. \n\nAlmost always the COO at a startup will be, or a VP of Ops will manage the finances. They'll work with an accounting team like Kruze to make sure all the monthly financials happen, the financials get closed, all questions are answered. Revenue Rec, expenses are all done correctly. All tax compliance is done correctly, like the tax return gets filed, your R&D Tax Credit gets done. Often, you'll be interviewed as part of the R&D Tax Credit process to make sure all the employee engineer allocations are done correctly, and the projects are documented. \n\nBut finance is gonna be something you do spend a lot of time on. Now, when you hire a VP of Finance or a CFO, this'll be much less part of your day. And that's kind of the rule for the VP of Ops or COO, you kinda have a lot of responsibility in the early days, and most startups kind of constantly are hiring like a functional expert to take things off your plate and the CEO's plate. That's just the name of the game, and really, it's always very refreshing when a company brings in someone to take a functional aspect of the company off your plate. It's very, very nice. \n\nSo you're gonna do finance. You will probably run, or have recruiting and HR reporting to you, but, you know, recruiting and HR kinda get lumped in together quite a bit, but they are two different functions, especially if you're growing fast and recruiting a lot of people. But HR and recruiting are typically an operations type of role. You wanna make sure that you're in compliance on things like your HR handbook, and that you're doing all the best practices for hiring. You wanna make sure that you have the right recruiting mechanisms in place, or you're working with recruiters on the outside, or you maybe have a dedicated team internally, so that's really important. Also, there's just kind of, this kind of straddles HR and operations, but there's gonna be a lot of insurance and nitty gritty things that you're gonna need to handle. \n\nLike this comes to mind, because you're always gonna wanna have employment liability insurance, and maybe you're gonna wanna have your, you know, your general liability insurance and all, errors and emissions and all these kinds of things. This is something that, because you're the COO or VP of Ops, you kinda sit across a lot of different functional aspects of the business. You need to remember to do these things and have these things in place. The next group you're gonna have reporting to you is typically like the technology group. \n\nNow, this is not like the rockstar developers, if you're a software company or a med tech company, or the scientists, you know, if you're a healthcare biotech company, because those usually report up to like the CTO or the Chief Medical Officer or the CEO. But like your technology group, your technology stack, the people who manage all of your technology, especially the IT services group, they're definitely gonna report up to you. That's just, that is an area of high risk for a VP of Ops or COO, you wanna make sure all this stuff is done correctly.",

      "description": "Accounting, Bookkeeping, Finance, HR, and Tax for Startups.\n\nKruze’s tax team helps hundreds of startups cumulatively save millions on their taxes every year - even unprofitable startups can benefit from tax credits. See how much a tax return might cost your company at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup_calculators/how-much-does-a-startup-tax-return-cost/\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHi guys, my name is Vanessa Kruze from Kruze Consulting, and today I wanted to go over with you how much should be a startup tax return cost. Here at Kruze Consulting we analyzed thousands of tax returns across many different types of business lines and we actually came up with a calculator that we published to our website at kruzeconsulting.com, so go ahead and check that out. But there are four main things that go into that calculator that I wanted to discuss with you, guys, today. The first thing that we took into consideration is your fundraising realm, are you a seed, series A, or series B company? That definitely folds into the cost. The second thing that we wanted to take into consideration is your industry, are you a marketplace, SASS company, or Fin-tech company? Depending on your industry, so if you're Fin-tech or marketplace, that can be more expensive than just say a plain vanilla SASS or text company. Next thing that we took into consideration is where you have Nexus, that translates into which states are we going to have to file a tax return for you. Where do you have payroll, where do you have rent, where do you have sales, all of that is going to fold of course into your tax return cost. The last thing that we took into consideration is your volume and complexity, do you have a lot of transactions or just a few? And then how complex are you, do you have international components or do you have a parent or subsidiary companies? That can definitely make the workload a little bit more extensive and hence the price go up a little bit more. Just to give you a sense of what a tax return should cost, a plain vanilla series A tech company can expect to spend around $2,000 for their annual tax return. I'm Vanessa Kruze, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, and check us out at kruzeconsulting.com, thanks.",

      "title": "Cooking the Books: What Every Accountant Should Know About Fraud?",
      "description": "In this video, you'll learn cooking the books, what every accountant should know about fraud.\n\nNeed help with your startup’s bookkeeping? Kruze Consulting is a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality financials to funded startups. Learn more at https://kruzeconsulting.com/startup-bookkeeping\n\nHey, it's Scott Orn at Kruze Consulting. And today I'm answering the question, what is cooking your books? \n\nThis is a slang term for committing financial fraud. So cooking your books is really cute, but you want to stay very, very far away from this. This is one of those things that will follow you through your whole career if you're involved in it. So integrity first, do not commit financial fraud. Now most people who are going to commit financial fraud are probably not going to be watching this or probably have already somehow justified it in their mind. So this is more for the people who are around those people or who may detect financial fraud is happening at their venture capital backed startup. \n\nAnd what do you do in that situation? It's kind of nerve-wracking 'cause what if you blow the whistle and people don't take you seriously and you get fired? Or what if the person retaliates against you and does something really, really nasty or threatens you or things like that? So my two cents is, first of all, a startup should always have an independent accounting firm working with them until there's quite a few people in the finance and accounting organization. So that's one way of reducing how financial fraud can be committed, is having checks and balances, having an outside firm, so one person does not control the books. \n\nWe've actually seen this before. We had a company that tried to onboard with us that ended up getting sued by the SEC and turns out they were committing financial fraud. And sure enough, I think the founder and the founder's uncle or something like that were doing the books. So always look for independents, and a second set of eyes is very, very important. \n\nNow if you are the person at the startup that sees financial fraud being committed, you really need to speak up, go talk to CEO, go talk to the CFO. If it's one of those people and you're very nervous about retaliation, of course you can check in with your independent accounting firm like us at Kruze, but you may have to go straight to a director to like one of the VCs who sits on the board. And they will be very appreciative, let me tell you. This happens sometimes. We've had a couple instances at Kruze where maybe someone in a position of power was buying a lot of stuff for themselves personally with the company's credit card. And we've had to confront them, and we've had to call the board and tell the board what's going on. \n\nSo it's a really, it's a kind of situation no one wants to be in. It really sucks. It's the classic, you know, \"Hey, life would be easier if you didn't have to worry about this.\" So you don't want to be seen as an accomplice, and you really do have the responsibility to speak out. So please do something about it if you see this, even if it's small, even if it's like $5,000, $10,000. Usually, when something like that's happening in a small amount, it's actually happening elsewhere in an organization or that person's committing something even worse, just bigger numbers. You're just not seeing it. \n\nSo speak up to the CEO, CFO, your direct boss. If those people might be in on it, then speak up to the board. The venture capitalist will be very, very appreciative. They want to know the stuff. They're fiduciaries of the business because they're on the board, and they're also fiduciaries of their fund and have a very, very strong obligation to find this stuff out, disclose it, and take care of it, get it fixed. So I hope that helps. \n\nAnd again, hopefully, you don't come into contact with anyone cooking their books.
